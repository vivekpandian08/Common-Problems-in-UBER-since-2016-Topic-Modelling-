2016-09-19 21:11:28+00:00,That wasn't a shot at Uber. That was saying that realistically it's almost impossible for any car to go somewhere on gameday
2016-09-19 19:28:56+00:00,It's not an uncommon thing bc this happens every gameday. Her calling an Uber was a bad idea

2016-09-19 19:27:30+00:00,Being said Contra-flow is set to control traffic after gameday due to the influx of city traffic
2016-09-19 19:26:43+00:00,The area for the uber was Baton Rouge at Louisiana State University. After a college football game

2017-12-13 15:47:59+00:00,How do you see fit to send me this email and yet not deal with my complaint? @Uber_Support 
2017-12-13 13:51:59+00:00,.@RacingPost @TheSun a bit rich to be complaining in public about 'service' when @Coral has been offline all day ... #glasshouses
2017-12-13 13:26:55+00:00,My @Uber driver swore at me and refused to let me out of the car last night &amp; @Uber_Support is ignoring my complaint

2017-12-13 11:35:33+00:00,Hi I’m having problems signing up could you help? @Uber_Support
2017-12-13 10:40:34+00:00,I have no interest in getting involved in another neverending email chain that results in nothing. @Uber I find it astonishing that you won’t provide a help line for an injured passenger. @TfL -can you assist?
2017-12-13 05:11:38+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support can I charge you $10 when a driver cancels me at the last minute?
2017-12-13 04:02:52+00:00,Hi @Uber_Australia @Uber_Support - you quickly charged me for an airport fare I didn't take with a driver who I didn't use as they were 30 minutes late and didn't answer my numerous calls. Why is it taking so long to reply to my messages about it?
2017-12-13 03:24:26+00:00,Landed with the light flex...ok
2017-12-13 01:50:37+00:00,Can't believe they're getting a bit touchy! Thought what he done wasn't considered that bad under Uber guidelines! As long as he says sorry even Khan will give him a glowing reference!
2017-12-13 01:34:18+00:00, genius! The frightening thing is though he would actually easily get through the system!!! Anyone asking for Muswell Hill is in trouble though! 
2017-12-13 00:57:28+00:00,I wasn't the passenger for him. He looked at me holding up my phone and showing him I wqs his next fair with absolute disdain and that is beyond unnaceptable
2017-12-12 23:03:50+00:00,"Sorry to disappoint you, but Uber refunded the money. “An Uber spokesperson confirmed the incident, and says the rider had been fully refunded. Uber staff say the massive over-charge was a result of driver error, not a technical glitch.”"
2017-12-12 21:27:40+00:00,"Don't worry, as a driver you'll only get $5 of that $18k."

2017-12-12 18:32:44+00:00,@UberUK Thanks for charging me £110 for a 4 mile trip after a 'clean up happened' that never occurred and was never mentioned by the driver in the completely unremarkable trip. My messages to @Uber_Support have not been answered. 
2017-12-12 15:01:07+00:00,"and here, exactly, @Uber THAT is your biggest failure. No one should be stuck with the petty app issues unable to secure a ride because you are TOO CHEAP to pay for 24 hour customer service with humans . Pay attention."

2017-12-12 01:10:41+00:00,"I know mistakes happen, but seriously? The response from @Uber is ridiculous. Unless the ride was in helicopter piloted by Luke Skywalker, this dude better get a refund."
2017-12-12 00:48:58+00:00,You decided to support a gig based economy over full time jobs. You supported a billionaire fueled system which brought down rates over a well regulated market. A choice was made - live with it.
2017-12-12 00:42:07+00:00,"Taking your word for it (without corroborating evidence), it is disappointing that Uber needed to be blasted on social media to correct their mistake. I don't care so much that the initial error was made, but to compound it by not making restitution is unacceptable."
2017-12-11 19:01:08+00:00,Hate to burst this bubble but something similar happened with friends of mine (black guy/Indian woman) and lyft recently. She had all the information and they refused to do anything about. Even refund their subsequent ride.
2017-12-11 13:09:35+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support i suggest you look closer to this lady's unacceptable experience or its the last time I use you.
2017-12-11 06:20:42+00:00,These kind of people are drivers. They are harassing us with full confidence and I am stunned to know that @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_PKR cant help us and won't compensate neither will take any action against them. I have stopped using Uber from today. Shame on you

2017-12-11 03:35:06+00:00,"Wow, this is so damn ridiculous. Sorry this happened, especially in front of the kids. So glad I don't use Uber anymore @Uber_Support"
2017-12-11 03:33:24+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support these are further reasons why I switched to Lyft months ago. You have to be kidding me that you can’t locate this driver by his phone number alone. This is unacceptable for a company to allow this to happen to its customers. Shameful
2017-12-11 03:23:56+00:00,"That's what I said! That's why I remembered the exact rating. Took one look and was like ""Hmmm 4.16? That's not good. But let's give him a chance..."""

And then you have the cheek to charge us a fiver for cancelling, I want my money back"
2017-12-10 10:15:52+00:00,"Uber drivers are annoying. I just booked one at the price I normally pay, and because it’s raining, they keep cancelling it and increasing it to a surcharge. I wish @Uber_Support could monitor that. It’s such a scam."
2017-12-10 07:16:24+00:00,I have always wondered are the uber fares at the time of booking indicative or are they like predecided rates.
2017-12-10 05:07:38+00:00,They waited over an hour for Uber when there are probably 5-10 taxi stands in that area?! Not to mention the T...I have no sympathy.
2017-12-10 02:57:56+00:00,It’s snowing and the roads are gross and instead of paying attention to the ROAD my Uber driver is showing me parrot videos. I’m just trying to get Home @Uber_Support wtf
2017-12-10 02:46:47+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support i don’t think drivers should accept a job if they are in the middle of one. Just saying

2017-12-09 10:22:00+00:00,"Nah. I'm not doing that. You're hearing my concern here. You've introduced a wait fee for driving having to wait two minutes, but riders get nothing regardless of how long they wait. That's not equitable.

2017-11-21 11:28:12+00:00,I think it is time we start calling out errant drivers on social media. Customers have been taken for a ride for too long. Many good drivers suffer cause of few bad ones. @uber and @lyft need to tighten control of errant drivers.
2017-11-20 22:29:41+00:00,"I did via the account involved. Most importantly I think you should know how your drivers are treating loyal, repetitive customers. Why I've included his info here. Unfortunate."

2017-09-14 10:49:55+00:00,considering the dodgy politics we've all heard from taxi drivers over the years I'd pay double for a driver who could chat nationalisation

2017-09-14 10:45:55+00:00,Self-identifying Blair-worshipper called Uber to complain because a driver supposedly talked to him about Momentum.

2017-09-14 08:57:03+00:00,Taxi drivers talk about that stuff all the time. Call yourself labour supporter but try to cost a guy his job.

2017-08-07 21:26:57+00:00,"They can't p/up at a cabstand, solicit rides or take street hails. Their business is through the APP & like cabs, stay out of bike lanes"
2017-08-07 21:20:57+00:00,I gave my driver a bad rating for trying to stop in bike lane. If a driver gets enough they lose fares. @Uber_Canada customers can help.

2017-08-03 01:21:49+00:00,"@Uber_Support all of my friends have gotten offers for Uber Pass, but it says sold out for me. How can I sign up?"

2017-08-03 00:40:49+00:00,"Shame on u @Uber_Support when your driver is rude &amp; won't share p/u location &amp; I get charged for cancel because ""it's our policy"", wrong!"
2017-08-03 00:35:20+00:00,@Uber_Support Hi Uber. I can't buy a Ride Pass from the app. This happened last month as well. My wife just bought one but I can't. Please. 
2017-08-02 19:42:20+00:00,@Uber_Support are you for real.. MAKE SURE YOU BRING DIPS. And a paid dip. And neither came...... 
2017-08-02 18:14:28+00:00,"Hey @Uber, your homophobic drivers are mistreating patrons and it's not right. Step up and fix this. @Uber_Support "
2017-08-02 14:40:59+00:00,That's why a black Taxi driver with the knowledge beats the sat nav every time
2017-08-02 13:21:53+00:00,I left my phone in an uber and it has no battery. I cannot log in without the SMS verification. What should I do @Uber_Support?
2017-08-02 12:58:29+00:00,When they write themselves 
2017-08-02 12:44:56+00:00,"And to be clear: 8 hours later not a single reply, apology or check up from @Uber_Support from their innumerable blunders last night. "
2017-08-02 05:44:16+00:00,Having the most uncomfortable Uber ride of my life. Taxi driver undercover?!?!! @Uber_Support

2017-08-01 15:01:12+00:00,".@Uber means great. This parking and or pick up is anything but... Bad bikelane blockers, bad. #BikeTO @Uber__Canada @Uber_Support"
2017-08-01 13:22:27+00:00,.@Uber_Support Please consider using @waze for your rides. Your drivers for #UberPool are taking the worst routes that double travel time.
2017-08-01 09:19:19+00:00,"Uber Make a complaint on the app, this happened to me and I got my money back within an hour and a credit on my account!"
2017-08-01 03:48:23+00:00,Rude!!!
2017-08-01 03:46:37+00:00,Go on the app and make a complaint. They'll usually credit your account back 
2017-08-01 03:21:47+00:00,That's ridiculous
2017-08-01 03:11:08+00:00,@Uber_Support my driver cancelled and I got charged £5 ??? 
2017-07-31 17:33:27+00:00,Ben I don't use SMH often but this is the appropriate time

2017-07-31 09:05:25+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_India (4/4) I tried to contact you at all platform but no one giving me response. Is it your sevice ?
2017-07-31 06:01:15+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support what the hell
2017-07-30 21:36:16+00:00,.@Uber_Support We've already been waiting 15 minutes I don't see why he's going over the bridge for this. 
2017-07-30 20:10:33+00:00,"Hi @Uber_Support I thought I would point out that my friends, who made the exact same journey but with 3 stop offs paid £75 less than me! "
2017-07-30 19:19:48+00:00,[cont'd] another reason I'm switching to @Lyft @AskLyft of the time. More bad #UBER is coming. @Uber_AZ @Uber_Support 
2017-07-30 19:17:33+00:00,@TfLTPH @MayorofLondon @Uber @UberUK @tfl @Uber_Support would any of you care to comment on this ? AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE THAT YOU ALLOW THIS 
2017-07-30 18:56:14+00:00,"A company's greatness can be judged by how it treats it's customer's concerns. You have earned my respect, Uber. Thanks for everything! "
2017-07-30 17:28:11+00:00,Maybe educate rather than rub people's noses in it. Nobody's benefiting from that.
2017-07-30 13:58:43+00:00,That's why London has Black Cabs....
2017-07-30 12:02:14+00:00,Maybe it's because you ordered from my @Uber_Support and not @UberEATS 
2017-07-30 04:32:54+00:00,Here's your confirmation message: I can confirm Uber is burning hundreds of millions in cash a year.
2017-07-30 00:22:54+00:00,Hello @UberUK @Uber_Support Why has your driver got his trousers down and is mastabating? 
2017-07-30 00:02:08+00:00,"Yes, and gave a laughable response. So you've now lost two customers for forever, @Uber, @Uber_Support. "
2017-07-29 19:57:36+00:00,.@Uber_Support hey my uber driver thinks we are in a photoshoot and is being an ableist telling me to watch her movie

2017-07-29 01:26:18+00:00,"wtf @Uber_Support ur driver called me a fatass then parked on the highway so he could watch his ""lord and savior"" fouseytube's video "
2017-07-28 04:40:57+00:00,DO YOU SEE WHY PSYCH EVALUATIONS ARE IMPORTANT
2017-07-27 23:37:30+00:00,@Uber_Support had the worst day trying to direct your drivers to a venue. And have been charged for out drivers cancelling. Sort it out.
2017-07-27 22:12:57+00:00,The sticker in window gives it away every time. They are often worse than taxis in my experience because no standardized training.
2017-07-27 22:10:38+00:00,"@Uber_Canada @Uber_Support, please stop doing this. #biketo @TPS_ParkingPal do @Uber next! Terrible driving."
2017-07-27 21:37:55+00:00,So did they not provide free soda? @ToddBrunson
2017-07-27 21:10:07+00:00,I dont think any company should make it easier for you to complain.
2017-07-27 20:34:40+00:00,Thanks @Uber_Support for handling this situation. Very professional response but you need an easier way to lodge complaint direct from app. 
2017-07-27 18:51:06+00:00,"Every time I have had to email @lyft they respond in 24 hours. I emailed @Uber @Uber_Support June 6th, no response until today July 26th."
2017-07-27 15:52:00+00:00,I don't understand why @Olacabs &amp; @Uber_Support @Uber not interested for regular cab service from Surat Airport
2017-07-27 14:02:19+00:00,"And then after 10 min, it says ETA 9 min. Empty road. 10 sec later it says ETA 2 min. FIX your pickup algo @uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India"

2017-07-26 22:04:54+00:00,I tried @uber when they first started in Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow. Each time ended up in a regular taxi instead. So app got uninstalled.
2017-07-26 21:44:09+00:00,"As an under 30 guy who eats McDonalds in San Francisco, you are a unicorn @lorotweets. They cannot afford to lose you."
2017-07-26 19:35:56+00:00,@Uber_Support don't do me like this...
2017-07-26 19:27:37+00:00,After a ride from HELL and @Uber_Support @Uber doing nothing I wouldn't recommend anyone to use their services.
2017-07-26 17:08:37+00:00,Why do you have to lie Uber? Look at what the website says:
2017-07-26 16:59:33+00:00,I made the mistake of riding with @Uber this morning. received an inappropriate message after the journey and @Uber_Support kinda ignored it
2017-07-26 16:41:25+00:00,"@Uber_Support I ordered at 11am, my order showed up an hour and a half later and I didn't receive any swag "
2017-07-26 16:38:35+00:00,Still waiting for a reply from @Uber_Support about the extra £70 they decided to take from my bank account 
2017-07-26 09:23:07+00:00,"ReTweet Guys! OLA's Great Way to fool Citizens, NO CC/DC option & as an excuse Ola says only ""for selected customer"" what a JOKE!"
2017-07-26 08:55:21+00:00,"We'll be happy to review this charge, Patrick! Please reach out at http://t.uber.com/cancellationcharge and we'll take a look."

2017-07-26 01:42:03+00:00,I'm glad it only took a month for you to take my concerns seriously. It shows how committed you are to anti-racism.
2017-07-25 22:58:23+00:00,no worries fam it was delicious
2017-07-25 21:22:34+00:00,@Uber_Support y’all needa handle this situation before I do smh

2017-07-25 01:39:25+00:00,"Unless I missed it, the site and subsequent link in the article didn't actually say which cities or locations."
2017-07-25 00:41:25+00:00,Uber is a scam. @Uber_Support

2017-07-24 04:42:21+00:00,What can I expect from @Uber these days? Driver cancels on the customer but they'll penalise the customer.
2017-07-24 02:53:17+00:00,"Hi @Uber_PH @Uber_Support, please fix your pool system. My drop off point is literally on the way, but my poolmate gets dropped off first? "

2017-07-18 14:40:27+00:00,What's not OK is the fact that you guys only pay $4 for a driver to spend an hour getting someone's Pad Thai. Follow up with THAT.

2017-04-24 13:38:01+00:00,That was not an attempt to be like #notalldrivers by the way. Moreso that there's no excuse.
2017-04-24 13:35:18+00:00,Hi Sean. I'm a driver who has transported a number of people with varying ability levels and that's disgusting and I'm so sorry.

2017-04-23 04:55:46+00:00,@Uber_Support why the fuck is @ilianablasdell banned from your app when she's done nothing??? no one will give her any information
2017-04-23 03:13:14+00:00,.@Uber_Support I just saw my receipt for uber trip that was supposed to be $35 and it was $53 is that because this driver had no clue?
2017-04-22 18:01:54+00:00,Amazing customer service by @UberEATS @Uber_Support today in regards to my terrible lunch with wrong items. Very impressed.
2017-04-22 15:46:02+00:00,.@travisk I'm a 4.98 rated driver going on 3 years. 2 yrs in a Benz. I'm switching to @lyft because of how bad @Uber_Support for drivers is.

2017-04-21 17:16:31+00:00,One of your drivers punched my friends daughter and also made a racist remark about her partner. She had a child with her.
2017-04-21 16:35:25+00:00,Me: Hey can I get a human to respond to me? These emails are robotic & impersonal. @Uber_Support: *calls me Joseph in form letter* 
2017-04-21 16:08:16+00:00,That's awful Lynn! My sister had a few similar stories. I'm glad you're ok but @Uber needs to properly address these type of situations!

2018-12-30 09:46:26+00:00,You driver cancels a trip and I am the one supposed to pay for it?? @Uber_Support
2018-12-30 07:36:16+00:00,"Uber you fake, she got a code from lyft. Guess I'm taking my business elsewhere."
2018-12-30 06:23:07+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support why don’t you stop with the generic responses and take some responsibility? Your initial response says your driver (a subcontractor under you employ) has the phone. This means it is your responsibility now so handle your business.
2018-12-30 06:15:13+00:00,"I don't know @UberIndia will attend to this because @UberEats is yet to reply on my Complaint even after 15 days. Eventhough it is different co, I feel attitude wise both are one and the same"
2018-12-30 01:37:28+00:00,Can you stop with the generic responses and just have an actual human communicate?
2018-12-29 23:49:33+00:00,"This happened to me 2 weeks ago, when they finally responded they gave me a really shitty response and haven’t replied since. TFL have got involved now, I’ll send you their details. Con artists mate, don’t use them again.@Uber_Support are awful as well."
2018-12-29 23:05:45+00:00,"@Uber_Support. I am 70+, furious. It's cold. Waited for 30+ minutes in cold for 3 Uber's, cancelled on me. On cane. What's happening with Uber drivers? Call me. Obviously you don't want to hear this. Difficult to get your attention. Terrible customer service."
2018-12-29 22:45:08+00:00,I can't believe Uber is stealing MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT... @dkhos @Uber_Support NO ONE WILL HELP YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK. #DARAKHOSROWSHAHI
2018-12-29 22:10:31+00:00,Did... Did you seriously just tell some to use your phone app support to get back his missing phone?
2018-12-29 21:57:48+00:00,Look on LinkedIn for Uber employees at the incident center in Phoenix and contact them directly. Also try @dkhos
2018-12-29 21:41:29+00:00,Wooow this some bullshit. The generic opened ended responses are damn near insulting. Hope you get your phone back man. Won’t be using that garbage company
2018-12-29 21:41:11+00:00,It’s been more than a week. I’ve been trying to follow up via email but all the responses I get are conflicting. I need help here.
2018-12-29 21:30:28+00:00,The email I just got says ‘you’ve done everything you can’. I don’t believe this.
2018-12-29 21:21:29+00:00,I ALREADY HAVE AND IT’S IN THE SUPPORT CASE.
2018-12-29 16:22:09+00:00,"A new low by @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber_BLR @Uber ! Absolutely no control over drivers &amp; airport ground staff.

2018-12-29 05:55:27+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support you erroneously charged me $400 for two trips I did not take when your app froze on me, and I can find no way on your app to get a refund. WTF?"

2018-12-28 07:09:36+00:00,Hey .@Uber_Support I was charged a $260.01 cancellation fee for a $7.99 fare! What on earth is going on? Your support features on the app have not been helpful. This is also not the address that I tried to book! Please help 
2018-12-30 19:22:05+00:00,It’s still doing it. On some roads it thinks east is west and vice versa. And in Kingston N.Y. it shows a speed limit of 25 mph on mile-long I-587; the actual limit is 55.
2018-12-30 14:38:53+00:00,Why £28 came out my account last night for an Uber I apparently got back in April?? @Uber @Uber_Support I’m confused help

2018-12-30 03:25:38+00:00,I swear to fucking god if @Uber @Uber_Support sends me the same fucking pasted generic ass bullshit response ONE MORE TIME I’m going to fucking lose it. WHY HAVE A SUPPORT FEATURE IF YOU LITERALLY CANT HELP ANYBODY EVER??????

2018-12-30 00:59:13+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber y'all seriously made me pay for a ride when I was actually SCARED of the driver. Your automated messages don't answer anything. You wanna fix this orrrrr? Cuz that's not okay.
2018-12-30 00:10:59+00:00,They removed the paypal payment option so it’s been quiet for them
2018-12-29 22:44:40+00:00,@Uber_Support is the least helpful support group ever... #whytho #help #yajerks
2018-12-29 21:53:26+00:00,Holy crap @Uber_Support surely you can provide better customer support than this and not just give him the runaround. 
2018-12-29 21:33:05+00:00,I once left my phone in a @lyft. Got it back that night. This is ridiculous and @Uber_Support is not covering itself in glory.
2018-12-29 21:24:31+00:00,"@Uber_Support I reported fraud on my account weeks ago, and Uber canceled my account. I was not responsible for those charges, and you all are punishing me by canceling my account for things that were out of my control. Y’all keep giving me the run around and I’m tired of this."
2018-12-29 21:20:30+00:00,".@UberEats @Uber_Support referring me to “specialist” support. So far no acknowledgement that a THREE HOUR delivery time is unacceptable (and not ASAP!). No way to cancel in app. Feel sorry for restaurant, whose food no doubt ruined because of “delay finding a delivery person” "
2018-12-29 20:58:44+00:00,Thank goodness for Grubhub right? Lol
2018-12-29 18:14:32+00:00,"I use your app for convenience but your new system is garbage and not only am I late to work, but I had to walk far just for my ride to get cancelled. @Uber @Uber_NYC @Uber_Support"
2018-12-29 17:45:13+00:00,Yo @Uber @Uber_Support - so yall are charging riders’ cards but not actually paying the drivers in Ghana?
2018-12-29 15:00:26+00:00,Just use @lyft and get rid of the app. I’ve been talking to their drivers and they are really unhappy. I stopped using them it use to be a good service
2018-12-29 14:57:02+00:00,"Just another reason why I don’t use @Uber . I keep hearing bad things about them. The CEO thing, drivers not being paid, and now this."
2018-12-29 12:36:10+00:00,So @Uber_Support says they “appreciate [my] understanding” that they’re only giving me a 25% refund after charging me double the price I was originally quoted. I hope they’ll appreciate that their shady ass business practices are why I’ll never use them again. 
2018-12-28 02:53:53+00:00,I ain’t no snitch #ididntdie 
2018-12-28 01:39:10+00:00,Wtf is this? Here I am in NYC & my matched driver is driving further into New Jersey. Surprised they didn’t match me with someone driving to California. @Uber @Uber_NYC @Uber_Support is such trash. #Uber
2018-12-28 01:09:27+00:00,Shocked to know how @Uber_BLR treating it's own Employee
2018-12-27 22:43:15+00:00,Charging me $5 when the driver cancels is bullshit @Uber_Support #uber I’m deleting this app for good. Only @lyft in 2019
2018-12-27 21:18:51+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support you need to fix your sutomer support ASAP. My account got hacked and as someone was literally using my account to call an Uber, the driver for the ride THAT I WAS NOT IN would not respond to any of my calls alerting him that the person was not me.. "

2018-12-27 15:55:52+00:00,@Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber_India @Uber_Support. He is one of the best driver we have met and extremely hard working. He has ensured customer delight not just satisfaction. Is this your reward for someone who slogs his Ass out for keeping your reputation higher????
2018-12-27 15:55:30+00:00,This is very sad. Well established company like Uber cheating poor diver. Think about customer then?? I won’t take Uber!

2018-12-27 13:26:10+00:00,I’m already talking to you guys via app. Just wanted people to be aware of the scams your drivers are trying.

2018-12-27 11:36:29+00:00,When u order an U. Will it turn up? Will it surge when it does turn up? Will driver be same one as it should be when it turns up? Will driver be able to get passengers to where they want to go? Will pass be involved in an accident Will pass be sexually assaulted Why use U?

My husband and I ordered a uber to take us to the airport (Southend Airport in london) but he had an accident while we were going to the airport and so, we missed our flight and spent 600€ for a new one and 200€ to take a taxi to Gatwik airport! Unacceptable!!"
2018-12-25 23:18:03+00:00,Contact their partners @TfLTPH and you will get dealt with quicker
2018-12-25 22:14:58+00:00,You’ll never get a phone number from them. The last thing they’ll ever to is attempt to talk to a rider. They couldn’t afford the call centre to accommodate the volume of complaint calls they get. Might be best to use another service next time you require a cab.
2018-12-25 19:38:48+00:00,"Working all Christmas Day... only go and leave my keys in the Uber at lunchtime. The driver is now coming to meet me to hand them back as I’m home alone. @Uber_Support, you have some great guys in your fleet!! Merry Christmas "

2018-12-22 10:40:28+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats It is disgusting that since the 21/11/2018 my query still hasnt been resolved even though I was TOLD it would be looked into the same day. Its been a whole damn month. Your customer service is disgraceful 
2018-12-22 06:08:31+00:00,I had an aggressive @Uber driver that made me feel incredibly unsafe. BUT someone named James from @Uber_Support handled the matter very professionally and with action steps. So thanks uber for believing a woman when she says she feels unsafe. Unfortunately that is still rare

2018-12-20 16:47:15+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support thank you for giving the driver $80 of my money for a door handle that some random drunk person threw up on. That was awesome I’m so glad you’re “unable to refund my money” for what someone else did.

2018-12-19 21:50:19+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_LA Why am I being charged more than what I was originally quoted? This doesn’t make sense since I was outside as soon as my Uber arrived. Also arrived a later than quoted.

2018-12-19 19:52:03+00:00,Report it your bank as fraud and insist on a refund. Ask them to 'stop' the card and send a replacement. Report it to the police as fraud - you can do it online. Instruct Uber to delete your details. Delete the app. Use local firms.
2018-12-19 18:02:25+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber You have drivers committing fraud in your system and your scripted email support is either unable or unwilling to understand this. I'm NOT looking for a refund. I'm telling you your drivers are robbing people. Who do I talk to? I have screenshots.

2018-12-15 20:29:00+00:00,1/3 I had the worst experience with #uber #ubereats @uber @Uber_Support last night. After waiting for two hours for food from Nando’s I got an sms to tell me my food cannot be delivered &amp; the order was cancelled. 2 hours later!!! The thing is we can’t cancel orders but they can.

2018-12-13 09:44:03+00:00,"I would seriously suggest you do some real research into this very dangerous company before putting anyone,(particularly a vulnerable person!) in one of their death traps. Thousands and thousands of complaints! I wouldn’t trust them with a house brick!!"
2018-12-12 23:58:09+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support what’s the protocol for drivers who have cameras to record passengers? I’ve gotten a note before my ride before, and was given the option to cancel. This driver said “it’s my private car and isn’t required” to notify passengers. Is that true? Even in DC?"
2018-12-12 22:21:14+00:00,They trying to support a $120 Billion valuation for their IPO. The only way to get there is ripping off drivers & riders. It’s like an epidemic.
2018-12-12 21:54:38+00:00,It happened again... accept the 3rd trip in the series and boom uber sends this error message and poof i am back to number 1 on consecutive trips even though the APP was the issue not me rejecting a trip What gives @Uber_Support

2018-12-12 13:00:10+00:00,Ok @Uber_Support I’m fucking done. First you try to scam me out of fare I rightfully deserved yesterday. Now today you won’t let me instant pay. I can’t wait to be done with your garbage ass company and app. You are losing another great driver. Congrats
2018-12-12 11:06:53+00:00,"Congrats & Good Luck! This is not an isolated issue, its global! Under CEO @dkhos #Uber has been raising the rider cost but taking more from the drivers portion. The results being that the quality of #Uber has collapsed. This will get worse until drivers feel well compensated."
2018-12-12 10:39:21+00:00,"I’m pregnant, on my way home asked the driver to make a quick stop at a roadside food vendor for a few mins.

2018-12-12 04:37:52+00:00,"Im a Realtor and drive all day. Ride share drivers are the worst. It’s like if a taxi company suddenly hired all their drivers at once without testing if they know how to safely city drive. Sudden turns, stop in middle of street, etc, etc."
2018-12-12 04:13:27+00:00,"@Uber_Support, do you care at all if your drives just disregard bike infrastructure? This diver really didn't care about running a red then driving into the (low) curb protected bike lane. #bikechi"
2018-12-12 02:33:47+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @AskLyft your driver BAA5091 nearly sideswiped me while making an illegal (and dangerous) pass to turn right on red onto a busy street.

2018-12-11 01:55:25+00:00,No response from any @uber or @Uber_Support account after hours of a global outage. Rides stranded and food not delivered. The clean up after this is going to be massive. And #uber isn't even trending? That's weird.
2018-12-11 01:48:00+00:00,That is ridiculous. They've been down for hours and yet no acknowledgement from any Uber account. Just sad!
2018-12-11 01:46:30+00:00,App was down. Drivers couldn’t see address and were unable to cancel. Be informed before you accuse someone of being a thief 
2018-12-11 01:33:21+00:00,"The @Uber_Support main feed has still not posted a tweet about their driver app being down for several hours, and as far as I'm aware @Uber has sent no official communication to American drivers about it"

2018-12-10 01:18:33+00:00,What's the difference between #UberBlackSUV and #LyftLux. @Uber guarantees black car service and @lyft does not. As I was embarrassed by @AskLyft when I ordered service but recieved a standard driver but was charged for Lux service. Use @Uber_Support over #Lyft it is safer.

2018-12-04 16:47:52+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support i raised my concern on 20th November and sent supported documents too still waiting for your feedback. Pathetic people. Is this the way u treat your customer
2018-12-04 16:15:00+00:00,They don’t have a number you can call and talk to someone for some reason. I had to write a report in the app and they told me that there was nothing they could do. So I continuously reported the driver until the gave me my money back took about a week
2018-12-04 15:48:53+00:00,it is. I saw this same exact thing somewhere else

2018-12-03 18:22:47+00:00,"Thanks @Uber for cancellation.... Driver phoned to check where I was, said see you soon then cancelled. Not impressed - rude and lazy. Great advert for you!!! @Uber_Support"
2018-12-03 17:29:28+00:00,I was walking home at the time. It shows it on my health app. I haven’t got that sort of money for something I didn’t use in December of all month. @Uber_Support

2018-12-03 06:53:08+00:00,@Uber_Support. My cousin and I @lexiconMC also waited +/- 2 hour from Silverstar Casino with 2 Uber drivers cancelling on us because a trip of R140 wasn't worth it. An Uber driver who had shown up for this white elderly couple we struck up a friendship with helped us as well.

Because there are hundreds of people complaining to @Uber_Support that their accounts were hacked and uber can't/won't stop the fraudulent charges.
2018-12-03 02:47:25+00:00,OMG you’re the next Scriven! Consumer Reports asked him to stop sending them letters about the flaws in their evaluation systems. You are providing the perfect update to that dynamic! #eval

Get back to me this is just ridiculous how you are playing with your loyal customers. @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_NYC

2018-12-03 00:44:38+00:00,ABSOLUTELY FUMING AT @Uber my driver has claimed £60 in cleaning fee’s from me after initially leaving me a review saying “great chat” ??? £60 is excessive when absolutely nothing was left in the car. I want this sorted ASAP @Uber_Support 
2018-12-02 23:01:10+00:00,.@Uber_Support you need to update your pool pickup algorhythm. Dis cray.

2018-12-02 14:19:39+00:00,@Uber_Support last night I was charged a cleaning fee 2 HOURS after we were dropped off. I need someone to look at this ASAP bc we didn’t leave any mess in his car.
2018-12-02 14:10:44+00:00,Dealing with @Uber_Support is almost as frustrating as Comcast. They don't listen and ignore what you are asking for. First thing I'll do after this trip is cancel @Uber
2018-12-02 09:47:37+00:00,"Pathetic service @Uber @Uber_Support . After reaching the pickup point, the driver calls and asks for destination and then cancels saying he won't go. Worst then kali-peeli drivers' attitude."
2018-12-02 06:28:10+00:00,"I overheard the officer telling the aggro Uber driver, ""You of all people should be setting a good example for other drivers!"" Are you listening @uber @uber_support?

2018-12-02 02:00:53+00:00,Hello @Uber_Support this is unacceptable - I am going to start posting screenshots. 
2018-12-02 00:45:35+00:00,My Uber driver is listening to a Republican talk show :/ what’s your plan to fix this @Uber_Support
2018-12-01 22:16:43+00:00,Had a lot more love from the ldn taxi industry than from Uber. In the back of a black cab as I type this. I’m done with Uber in ldn.
2018-12-01 22:11:14+00:00,Twice in the last 2 weeks @Uber_Support I’ve had drivers show up with other people in their car. Because they then cancel there’s no way to give feedback about the drivers. “You didn’t get charged” autoreply isn’t good enough. You should know about these drivers. cc @Uber_Canada
2018-12-01 22:06:59+00:00,Great to have you back.

2018-12-01 01:30:40+00:00,hey @Uber @Uber_Support why do i get charged $5 when i try to cancel a trip after waiting for 15 minutes for a pickup but then the driver cancels my trip after i waited that long and leaves me hanging? does the driver pay me a fee?
2018-12-01 01:24:56+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support y'all better fix this earnings issue ASAP. Rent is due tomorrow and we need this money NOW. 
2018-12-01 01:24:05+00:00,@Uber_Support I just had two drivers cancel on me after they asked where I was going and they didn’t like my answer. The destination is within your coverage area. Why is it that drivers can cancel on me without penalty whereas I get charged?

2018-12-01 00:11:01+00:00,A lot of drunk people are going to end up on the road tonight if they don’t get this fixed ASAP.

2018-11-26 23:08:25+00:00,"@Uber_Support Somebody must be smoking funny stuff at Uber HQ these days. ""You’ll see higher time based rates, balanced by lower distance rates."" This looks like another pay cut to drivers."
2018-11-26 22:25:00+00:00,you could be like “my uber driver stabbed me” and @Uber_Support would just be like “thanks for the feedback :)”

2018-11-26 16:10:56+00:00,I would have taken it and sent it him back but I had the smallest bag with me Saturday so it wouldn’t fit and the @Uber driver said I had to give it him so he could report it missing and said he was going to give it back to the boy. @Uber_Support 
2018-11-26 16:02:10+00:00,I didn’t release it was so hard to find ONE OF YOUR DRIVERS on your books and get his personal information and tell him to give it back. WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO!! This boy is a student who can’t afford to lose his wallet and uni passes! @Uber_Support @Uber

2018-11-24 13:44:47+00:00,Dear @Uber what's wrong with your drivers? They ask where the cab is booked for... and then start thinking if they want to come. This just keeps getting worse. I don't even want to get talk abt behavioural patterns. Not done! @Uber_Support

2018-11-23 00:46:35+00:00,@Uber_Support a driver called me to see where I was going and he said if it’s not an area he was wanted to drive in he wouldn’t pick us up. When we told him he immediately hung up and cancelled our trip here’s his details. Can you help advise.

Now I’m on my Honeymoon in Portugal and I’m informed my account has been suspended. So I have to use taxis. Please RT.
2018-11-22 05:06:41+00:00,No @Uber @Uber_Support driver is ever ready to pick up the passenger unless you tell him ur destination. Then they will either cancel the trip or just be around but not reach you forcing you to cancel. Just waisted half an hour doing this with 4 drivers. Hired @Olacabs now.

2018-11-21 14:27:42+00:00,He probably forgot to schedule the pickup.
2018-11-21 14:22:37+00:00,Thanks but he has filled it out three times already and not gotten any help. How can he actually get a response? @Uber @Uber_Support 
2018-11-21 14:20:56+00:00,"Uh oh. This response definitely won't help his aggrieved 'woe is me, everybody hates Republicans' narrative. Most likely he will ignore and keep bitching."
2018-11-21 14:20:00+00:00,He's probably making it up for attention.

2018-11-20 16:56:39+00:00,Fun fact: those two services actually share a customer service twitter handle @Uber_Support BECAUSE THEY ARE LITERALLY THE SAME COMPANY. How many years does it take to create saftey regulations for passenger transport?

The Uber driver looked at me &amp; said ‘sorry- McDonalds ran out of burgers’. I was livid.
2018-11-19 01:32:09+00:00,Thank you @Uber_Support for investigating my claim and refunding my money. Please consider updating you policy so that drivers must inform passengers of the fee prior to leaving them. Charging fees 2 hours later allows for scamming to occur!
2018-11-19 01:09:36+00:00,FUCK @Uber_Support and @Uber your drivers are frauds and you let them charge customers extra for no reason!!!

My tweet isn’t a criticism of Uber (even though there are scads of valid criticisms of Uber) but rather it’s about some jackass with an unstable job for a corporation that puts financial risks on him that should be shouldered by his employer. Have a nice day!
2018-11-16 09:40:20+00:00,Then choose another mode of transport ! When you use Uber they so cheap they lose money to make existing modes of bankrupt! Once there’s no competition you’d have no choice! Now you do!
2018-11-16 05:03:33+00:00,Nah I don’t fight with companies. I move on. Plenty of fish in the sea. Thanks tho.
2018-11-16 03:44:24+00:00,@Uber_Support please tell your drivers to stop asking where they are going and lecturing me about short trips. It's snowing and wet here in Toronto. I can't afford to fall or get sick and I can't see the road markings. Getting home safely is a priority. I paid for my ride.
2018-11-16 02:31:09+00:00,"@Uber_Support is a scam. Due to inclement weather, a normally 30 dollar ride cost $240. That was NOT the agreed upon price when entering the car."

2018-11-16 01:17:20+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Y’ALL ARE BUGGING. There is a heavy snowstorm in the Bronx and I am pregnant. This is unfair. 
2018-11-15 23:38:35+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support check your driver's because they're cancelling rides and acting rude because of rider destinations. That's disrespectful. #uber #UberDriver #uberrider
2018-11-15 22:36:15+00:00,Uber is trash everything that Uber is doing is trash can’t wait to immediately delete this app @Uber_Support @UberEng
2018-11-15 21:09:54+00:00,Someone please explain to me how this is safe driving???? @uber @Uber_Support 
2018-11-15 20:25:34+00:00,"I was just hacked again i guess. saw a payment come in for $7 from uber, then an email came in chinese. i did not use uber today, but it hit my amex card. i can’t even login to uber now. why does his keep happening with uber???"
2018-11-15 17:18:45+00:00,Haha funny!
2018-11-15 16:09:08+00:00,Hi .@Uber_Support I’d like to file a complaint against one of your Uber drivers. Her name is Madison Montgomery and she called me an “ugly faggot” before forcing me to rate her 5 stars. I took a picture of her here pic.twitter.com/CsEAylKz8e
2018-11-15 15:12:18+00:00,This ain’t it @Uber_Support 
2018-11-15 14:56:15+00:00,Is this a joke @Uber_Support 
2018-11-15 08:10:42+00:00,Time is money 4 your drivers(employees) if U don’t respect them how do you we ensure U respect our (customer) time. #doubleStandards #harrasmentOnMen #RespectMen #time thanks to @MPalSingh1981 for raising this concern &amp; jelp serving the customers; Male @Uber working efficiently
2018-11-15 04:04:41+00:00,My complaint letter to @Uber @Uber_Support will never see the light of human because they rely almost exclusively on bots &amp; automated support. Ok. Done venting. Terrible company. Hope none of my followers are ever in a position where they need Uber CS. Deleted &amp; deactivated. 
2018-11-15 03:55:19+00:00,"Each time i book an Uber, typical response of the drivers when i call them is: ""where are you going?"". And when i tell them destination they say. ""I am not interested in going there, if you wish i can forward your booking."" This is pathetic service. @Uber @Uber_Support"
2018-11-15 02:42:52+00:00,Sure.
2018-11-15 02:24:06+00:00,"Dear @Uber @Uber_Support when u r booking a cab, it shows 2mins. When it gets booked, it shows 23 mins. And then wen u cancel the cab, u get charged! Happens pretty often these days! Kinda pattern. "

2018-11-14 14:55:44+00:00,Why not discuss here as it seems same problem is faces by a lot of people here.
2018-11-14 14:21:37+00:00,"Hope you do the right thing and provide compensation, @Uber @Uber_Support - while I rely greatly on your services and appreciate how you have changed my life, I can vouch for the fact that your scheduled pick-ups are very unreliable and risky. "
2018-11-14 12:59:11+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support is there a way can make your email receipts REALLY short? 1 trip runs to 2 pages or more! Imagine if you had to print 10 or more trips. Lets save the trees...
2018-11-14 12:10:58+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support @dkhos There is no actually scheduled driver for what you’re selling riders you’re charging premium price you’re not passing it on to drivers just more smoke and mirrors nothing's changed!
2018-11-14 12:08:45+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @dkhos Ur scheduled Uber pick up hustle is catching up with you getting complaints from riders and drivers you’re charging the rider high price but you’re not passing it on to drivers there’s no actually scheduled driver whoever is in the area gets the trip!
2018-11-14 09:05:13+00:00,We have seen many instances like this in recent times. @Uber_India seems to have a clear bias against the language of the land (Kannada). This is not acceptable. Request @kdabengaluru to look into this. @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_Support @CMofKarnataka @GCC_MP
2018-11-14 08:38:35+00:00,@Uber_India @Uber @Uber_Support he speaks kannada well and good.. But what ur profile says remove hindi and bangalore. Corect the things else it not good for u. #boycottuber @CMofKarnataka @KarnatakaVarthe @PLEKarnataka @KannadaGrahaka
2018-11-14 07:39:54+00:00,"Not only do they have a complaints team, they now also have a ‘specialised’ complaints team. Hilarious. "
2018-11-14 04:44:47+00:00,"After 48 hours of the worst customer service experience of my life, I’m thrilled to delete my @Uber_Support @Uber account. They will NEVER see a penny from me again. F$@k you, Uber."
2018-11-14 03:03:10+00:00,"Oh dear another victim of the Uber sick scam, the drivers are fighting back because they’ve had enough of being treated like slaves, all lost property is finders keepers and the fake sick scam is just a little bonus !! Unfortunately Uber only attracts the unemployable "
2018-11-13 23:54:08+00:00,"Ok @Uber_Support this is not ok. The driver gets lost twice trying to get to my location/ HE CANCELS, and you charge ME $5 to compensate his incompetence? NO NO NO "
2018-11-13 22:01:33+00:00,Well if there is one thing I've learned in the last month is it if you have an issue with @Uber good luck getting any help resolving it. @Uber_Support is useless and they don't even have a customer service phone number. #frustrated #terriblecustomerservice #sorryfortherant
2018-11-13 10:28:28+00:00,ask to see the cleaning receipt and also ask for the drivers job history. If he picked up a job directly after dropping you off he clearly didn’t stop to have the alleged mess cleaned up. It’s a scam.
2018-11-13 08:00:28+00:00,"You are correct. I've never had a black cab refuse to take me home from town on a friday/Saturday night. ""Sorry pal not going that way...."""
2018-11-13 04:15:41+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support SEVEN drivers have cancelled on me and I’ve been waiting outside now for over an hour. What’s the deal? Why do I get charged when I cancel but this happens?
2018-11-13 01:48:27+00:00,@Uber_Support #UberPremier whatever driver will ask cash or card and cut the trip if card or Paytm. This will happen when you are going out on urgency. Many times autos rock than greedy Uber
2018-11-13 01:44:39+00:00,I'm creating a Lyft account after many years of loyal and heavy Uber use. Ultimately it came down to a complete and total lack of customer service when I finally had a real issue and needed help. @Uber_Support
2018-11-13 00:28:50+00:00,"Looks like I did an Uber trip for free today, 12.5 miles. The passenger was nice & tipped me $3, but Uber kept 100% of the fare, guess they thought the tip was enough."
2018-11-12 23:40:09+00:00,"Excuse me @Uber_Support can you explain to me how one of your partner drivers has made you the company charge me £85 cleaning fee for what was posted in the picture? A bold faced lie in fact my £20 journey became over £100 this is despicable, do you hire frauds? #uber #uberfraud"
2018-11-12 23:35:55+00:00,Because they don't give a crap.
2018-11-12 23:00:55+00:00,I’ve tried it seems that they are either incapable of reading or incapable of understanding that it doesn’t make sense to charge me for a mess I didn’t make. But then again apparently it’s a theme for your company 
2018-11-12 22:55:02+00:00,"Wow, must have been a terrible 4 minutes!"
2018-11-12 22:31:25+00:00,@Uber_Support Please inform me why I do not get paid a fare on a 22 minute/12 mile ride. The passenger was nice enough to tip me $3.00 but Uber kept the WHOLE fare. Does Uber now keep the whole fare if a passenger tips? 
2018-11-12 21:27:27+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I dont like being charged a cancellation fee when my driver makes me walk two blocks only to drive around and pick me up later. Would appreciate if someone reached out.
2018-11-12 19:10:28+00:00,"You’re trolling me now, right @Uber @Uber_Support @UberUK @UberUKsupport"
2018-11-12 18:09:19+00:00,Thank you @Uber_Support for responding to this is so promptly. @frodofied has a large following and we will ALL be awaiting the resolution.
2018-11-12 16:39:10+00:00,"I think this surge was because of the weather. The cancellation was not my fault,had your driver delivered his services the surge would have missed me. Please re fund my (80-65) R15. Do not dm me just re fund me please and deal with your dodge drivers. @Uber @Uber_Support"
2018-11-12 16:19:55+00:00,Hey @uber_support please contact me ASAP. Just had a HUGE issue with my fare after driver dropped me off.
2018-11-12 15:40:08+00:00,Update: @Uber_Support @UberEats did not further assist me and in fact did not even follow up at all with me in response. I’m out.
2018-11-12 05:13:03+00:00,hi @Uber_Support someone is using my account to go to the strip club and i have insufficient funds now so pls help me figure this out (:
2018-11-12 04:40:33+00:00,"and what's @Uber_Support's response? ""oh your uber dropped you off 5 blocks away from your house instead of at your house, so that's why we charged you $15 more"" should've installed lyft sooner honestly "
2018-11-12 04:33:13+00:00,"I was ditched by four @Uber_Support drivers at Lucknow airport. When i cancelled the fifth which was ten minutes away, Uber charged me for cancellation. For months, they kept dilly dallying and finally the complaint was closed without any action."
2018-11-12 04:22:00+00:00,I agree It’s the point . It happens to me at the airport so many times.
2018-11-12 00:19:56+00:00,This is actually a popular driver scam. Drivers do it often. And hope the customer doesn’t respond to Uber. It’s a virtual free roll for them to never actually drive
2018-11-10 10:27:56+00:00,Have been charged ₹420 for a ride in delhi to delhi via @Uber @Uber_Support in which I paid ₹211 as toll only. Wrote an email to @Uber but got no reply. Can anyone suggest where should I complain regarding the same ??
2018-11-10 08:54:28+00:00,"We're sorry to hear about the trouble. Please send us a DM with the email address or phone number, date of the trip and fare you were charged so that we can further assist."

2018-11-10 01:36:04+00:00,Idk why I gotta tell my Uber drivers to fucking use their blinkers. I got the pack on me stoopid @Uber_Support
2018-11-10 01:34:45+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support needs to refund you
2018-11-10 00:40:42+00:00,@Uber_Support ITS incredible that I ve been 4 hours trying to reach somebody but all I get is robots and nonsense. IS THERE A HUMAN BEING IN THERE????
2018-11-09 23:49:04+00:00,@Uber_Support why are drivers allowed to accept a new trip when they’re dropping someone off more than 5 min away? This happens constantly and I am now going to be extremely late.
2018-11-09 22:47:52+00:00,nothing bad happened omg
2018-11-09 22:45:23+00:00,SIXTH @Uber to cancel on me. I’ve been standing out in the rain for 15 minutes. This driver even called to ask my destination before then cancelling! @Uber_Support this is BEYOND a joke! 
2018-11-09 19:23:38+00:00,@uber_uganda @Uber_Support @Uber it is not my responsibility as a customer to train your drivers. Data needs to stay on during a trip GPS needs to stay on during a trip A cash customer can have credit I have the right to choose a preferred route during a trip!!!
2018-11-09 18:27:59+00:00,Never order from @frozenbottle_in @UberEats @Uber_Support @UberSoc spread this @UfterYou @MumbaiMirror @ZeeNews @jagograhakjago @CMOMaharashtra @fssaiindia
2018-11-09 16:50:08+00:00,I dmd you and now you’re not replying capping for the TL like you’re helpful terrible!
2018-11-09 16:39:06+00:00,How @Uber_Support just told me my ride was $9.90 nd charged me $20 I’m confused honestly I’m done I’m deleting this whole app. And I want my $10.10 refund
2018-11-09 16:36:37+00:00,Just waited from 8:08 to 8:32 for an Uber that was 8 mins away to pick me up only for them to get a minute away & cancel completely unacceptable I need a refund of my next trip after & I got charged a $5 that I can only be credited. @Uber_Support
2018-11-09 16:09:39+00:00,"Well, we're done with @Uber @Uber_Support after an absolutely awful ride this week cost my partner a job. Terrible driver, terrible contact from company. No more. I'd suggest you all do the same."
2018-11-09 14:00:21+00:00,"Made an order to my ‘current location’ driver ended up two miles away, then told me he would arrange with Uber to sort out, and I just got a message saying sorry your order was cancelled."
2018-11-09 13:57:27+00:00,Would love your help with an order. Very disappointed so far. @Uber_Support
2018-11-09 11:34:23+00:00,"Thanks, i will! (The joke is that if you are named after a famous communist political theorist, you’re probably anti-capitalism/tips on principle!)"
2018-11-09 03:32:46+00:00,Hello @Uber @Uber_Support I would like you to include 'spat on a public road' and 'threw trash on a public road' in the list of complaint against your driver partners. Hope you'll oblige. These issues may be specific to India.
2018-11-08 22:54:20+00:00,@Uber_Support I’m a regular @Uber customer. You’re hardworking and highly rated drivers deserve better than this.
2018-11-08 22:32:48+00:00,@uber @uber_support @uber_qld safety on the road should mean safety for both the passenger and the driver. Shame on you for treating your employees like this. Couldn’t implement a simple “reason for cancellation” reporting system?
2018-11-08 20:48:19+00:00,Em....guess you're not into dipping chips in shakes so
2018-11-08 20:27:37+00:00,Same here. My ride home used to be under $15 every day - sometimes as low as $11 - bought the ride pass and it magically changed my every day ride to $17.49. Thanks @uber
2018-11-08 17:50:04+00:00,"Feel Like @Uber @Uber_Support Should Reward Frequent Riders With Discounts and Rewards For Riding Often, Every 10 Rides Next One Free or Something Smh"
2018-11-08 15:41:36+00:00,These incentive bonuses are a JOKE @Uber_Support a real tier bonus program should not be a choose one option. The bonuses should just be a simple tier and whatever the driver does they get that bonus. Selecting a bonus is total B.S 
2018-11-08 14:59:07+00:00,Who needs FOUR of these at once??? That’s not how they work! Can we please ban this toxic crap @Uber_Support @AskLyft

2018-11-08 00:29:14+00:00,.@Uber @Uber_Support fix your mapping/gps please and thank you. This is the 4th time in 5 days that drivers got lost trying to find OBVIOUS locations and I get charged a wait fee when I’m the one waiting outside each and every time ON THEM. Used to love Uber. What’s going on?
2018-11-07 21:18:30+00:00,Do not listen to this guy. He got in my Uber and attempted run after he had no money!
2018-11-07 19:54:23+00:00,I've heard Hollywood types like to employ immigrants on work visas because they can't complain about the crazy or they'll be fired & deported. They get a super compliant employee who'll work far more hours than they're paid. If there's an 'incident' they can be quietly sent away.
2018-11-07 19:42:44+00:00,"I actually feel terrible for minority employees that drive for @Uber. If a white person records you merely defending yourself against their racism &amp; bigotry, @Uber_Support will suspend you &amp; support the racists (like they did with @tarastrong &amp; @RenaSofer). Good luck out there!"
2018-11-07 19:24:13+00:00,".@Uber/@Uber_Support has made a terrible decision in suspending their immigrant employee who was attacked with racism, bigotry, and threats by 2 passengers that obviously antagonized the situation. Appalled Uber would let them harass &amp; exploit an immigrant, then punish him for it"
2018-11-07 18:45:57+00:00,"Hey @David_Lohr, I saw your article about @Uber_Support @uber and they are doing something similar me and my bf. See my twitter for the longer version; they charged us $150 for a cleanup when we only had luggage coming from a hotel in the late morning..."

2018-11-07 15:57:47+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I missed my bus because one of your drivers decided to cancel the trip after I waited 10 minutes for him. The next waiting time made me late and now I had to pay almost 40€ for a train ticket.

2018-11-07 07:39:31+00:00,I'd have thought you'd have taken it down because it made you look ridiculous. Just goes to show most people are very bad at arguing politics.

2018-11-06 22:46:21+00:00,Yep you see how they totally forgot about DACA when they started to speak against dems
2018-11-06 22:34:41+00:00,Glad to hear it. Wishing your country good luck in the elections. Hope the wave hits Trump & GOP like a tsunami..! 
2018-11-06 22:32:18+00:00,I did. @Uber_Support was very helpful. 
2018-11-06 22:00:55+00:00,Those women were BAITING that Uber driver & THEN started recording. The only ppl making a situation DANGEROUS were the 2 shouting at a guy behind the wheel of car they were riding in. They endangered his life as well. His opinion didn’t matter becoz he wasn’t born here.
2018-11-06 21:57:31+00:00,"When someone is racist to you— even if you’re on the clock in a customer service oriented role, you’re allowed to condemn it and shouldn’t fear losing your job for doing so. I’m sorry white “progressives” like @tarastrong &amp; @RenaSofer don’t understand that. @Uber_Support better!"
2018-11-06 21:42:56+00:00,This woman —claimed the driver was unsafe without proof —made racist comments insinuating she was superior for not being an immigrant —insulted the driver while antagonizing him with a camera —threatened the man’s livelihood for defending himself against their rudeness BAN HER!!
2018-11-06 21:16:56+00:00,So please post the beginning of the video. How does this conversation/fight even begin?
2018-11-06 21:14:57+00:00,"Hey Laura, this is a safety issue, not a political one. I pray you never feel as unsafe as we did for the 15 min of abuse we took. I have it all on video."
2018-11-06 21:13:29+00:00,He was on a highway. Did you watch the video? He got off at the first exit to let them off and was pulling over as soon as he could until the yelled more at him to find a “gas station”. I want to see what happened before they started recording and baiting him.
2018-11-06 20:31:34+00:00,"Please retweet this and @Uber @Uber_Support My son uses Uber quite often, but he won’t be anymore if nothing is done about this. Regardless of political ideology, the behavior of this driver was dangerous and unacceptable. Please advise of your corrective action. "
2018-11-06 20:07:14+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support - Is this okay by you? Is this how you want your drivers treating passengers? What are you going to do?
2018-11-06 20:03:01+00:00,"""White woman posts anti-immigrant screed; Uber terminates driver"" can't wait!"
2018-11-06 19:44:01+00:00,A driver screaming at passengers bc of their political affiliation isn’t a “both sides” argument. He should be fired. No one reads Uber reviews. You take who picks up the ride. By the time you start reading reviews they’re outside. Lol
2018-11-06 19:38:27+00:00,"The customers conversation is not any of the drivers business. He is a angry man, and should not be representing your company!"
2018-11-06 19:25:43+00:00,The closer look should be not allowing this erratic person to ever drive on behalf of your company again. He is not fit to be in customer service if he endangers passengers by ranting conspiracy theory nonsense instead of paying attention to the road.
2018-11-06 19:19:24+00:00,@Uber_Support y’all better do something about this
2018-11-06 15:28:06+00:00,#Uber did it again. My colleague took an uber in the morning. The driver started stalking her. #ubersafe is just an advertising gimmick. Shameful. @Uber @UberFacts @Uber_Support @Uber_India @MumbaiPolice

2018-11-01 14:10:31+00:00,Is this my life now? Just retweeting myself day after day hoping someone from a large and profitable company will reply to my serious complaint.

2018-10-30 20:33:07+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support stop running commercials about improving the customer experience if you really are avoiding any mechanism to remedy a bad one. You know who does have a number you can call to resolve an issue ASAP? A taxi company.

I get in the Uber and there is another person in my Uber asking me extremely personal questions while the driver stares at me in the mirror. I got out the car early and they watched me walk off @Uber_Support
2018-10-27 14:04:25+00:00,It has now been two weeks since I have been asking @Uber_Support to either contact me by email or provide me with the phone number/email address of someone I can speak to about one of their drivers crashing into my parked car. No answer. Unbelievable.

2018-10-27 06:53:37+00:00,Convinced @CK_Smitty to download @Uber_Support . His first ride someone gets in our car and the driver knowingly takes them to their destination. Safe to say he won’t be using Uber again.
2018-10-27 06:06:28+00:00,My driver started the trip without me. I tried to call him but he stopped picking up the phone. @Uber_Support please refund the money deducted. I raised a request and got a reply stating that money cannot be refunded. Highly unprofessional!
2018-10-27 02:47:16+00:00,"But why should I have to pay @Uber when the driver had ME waiting, the app said 3 minutes for about 10 minutes and he didn't even try to contact me at all... Also, I've tried to reset my password like 4 times &amp; the link won't work. I don't understand @Uber_Support"

2018-10-26 06:02:50+00:00,This strike is crippling. People dependent on public transport should not have to suffer because of internal issues between drivers and companies @Uber_India @Olacabs @ola_supports @Uber_Support 
2018-10-26 05:11:42+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Morning rides like this? Highly disappointed by the quality. 
2018-10-26 04:34:50+00:00,"Once again the pathetic customer service returns by @Uber_Support @UberINSupport your driver not only threatened to throw me out of the cab mid way but also shouted at me and harassed me, when I refused to get out of the cab.I need to file an official complaint, pls guide."
2018-10-26 03:27:21+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, I took a @jump_rides bike out for a spin, but it appears I was charged, even though I have $15 in @AskAmex credits. If you can use these credits on @UberEats (another app), why not on bikes through your own app?"
2018-10-26 02:15:48+00:00,Ubar offered me ride on Rs. 119 and they charged Rs 224. Once think before book @Uber cab. @Uber_Support 
2018-10-25 20:06:57+00:00,@Uber_Support does this happen often? charges went through my paypal account today without knowing what has happened 
2018-10-25 19:14:59+00:00,Oh awesome... someone else took an @Uber logged in as me. Never really thought of that being possible. @Uber_Support what do I do??
2018-10-25 18:07:12+00:00,Nah not for me it isn’t. Uber are scum and for the sake of a couple of quid I’d prefer to use a proper taxi or company . I hope after all your hard work studying someone unqualified and illegal doesn’t undercut you and pip you to a job in your chosen field.
2018-10-25 14:18:56+00:00,@wheelygoodtimes It’s not as easy as a.b.c I hear you loud and clear.. If you have to move around a lot the cost can mount up although Taxis imho aren’t expensive around town and we don’t surge but I get your point If you ever find yourself in my Taxi it will be on the house 
2018-10-25 14:04:33+00:00,I had to spend £46k in March to be able to safely take wheelchair users safely and in comfort. You prefer a company that has virtually no wheelchair accessible cars at all . What happens when Uber win and all ‘taxis’ are just saloons and they can charge what they want ?
2018-10-25 13:44:54+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support what is the use of taking monthly pass when the rates are more than double of what I normally pay without pass?
2018-10-25 12:39:55+00:00,This is really bad! @Uber @Uber_Support Really think you need to sort it out ASAP! 
2018-10-25 12:17:21+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support Why did you disable the phone number anonymiser in Japan without warning drivers? Customers are being shown our personal phone numbers. This is a massive problem for a company that’s already had privacy problems.
2018-10-25 09:12:42+00:00,Aye but she doesn’t want to pay the going rate for the proper facility vehicle.
2018-10-25 04:41:14+00:00,Yooooo you my friend are a fool 
2018-10-25 04:16:57+00:00,How about you sent this to sky news so they can broadcast it how bad this company is. Just look at all the stories on this 1 feed to back it up 
2018-10-25 04:16:02+00:00,This is one of the most ridiculous tweets I’ve seen. You get thrown out of one then you order another. Words fail me. I always imagined that @SkyNews paid their staff well enough not to have to use such a cheap firm
2018-10-25 00:49:23+00:00,So bad uber driver left you high you moan about it on social media then book another . Talk about glutton for punishment
2018-10-24 23:37:07+00:00,It is also illegal. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/law-change-demands-equal-treatment-for-disabled-taxi-users @Uber
2018-10-24 20:57:11+00:00,"Oh lovey, take a hint from an old girl, you can't trust a PH firm to drive you from A to B who don't have a) contact landline telephone number b) who treat their drivers as modern day slaves and c) their customers as mugs."
2018-10-24 18:36:44+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Just found 237 fraudulent charges on the company credit card and you want us to file a police report and get a signed affidavit before you'll even start to investigate this $8000 computer glitch? WTF? #OneMoreReasonToTakeLyft #ThankGodForAmericanExpress
2018-10-24 17:06:50+00:00,CC: @Uber_Support - this is reckless driving.
2018-10-24 16:25:07+00:00,Na na na too late for all that now. I’ll be emailing you a letter of demand
2018-10-24 14:52:30+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support way to screw over your drivers. Time to start using @lyft pay @ITSCHAMPBABY his money. @AskLyft
2018-10-24 13:42:39+00:00,@Uber_Support yo Uber. Let me get this straight...you made a mistake...and to compensate you offer 10% off rides which OVERRIDES my current promo of $5 off each ride. So your attempt to fix an error is now costing me money? That's whack. 
2018-10-24 13:21:47+00:00,Dear @Uber @Uber_Support I was happily on my way into town when the Uber driver stopped saying the job had been cancelled - no one cancelled and now I’m standing in the Wandsworth one way waiting for a new Uber 6 mins away while my Uber drove off 
2018-10-24 12:10:59+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber @UberSoc right now @lyft is doing the right thing socially. Building social capital. Where do you as a company stand on this issue?
2018-10-24 07:52:46+00:00,"Great service @Uber_Support , trying to book a cab since last 15 mins. No cabs, no autos available. Commendable!!"
2018-10-24 07:30:11+00:00,"To think uber doesn’t have guidelines and or reimbursement for this type of situation, it could happen to anyone, I’m usually so intrigued by Uber’s customer service, SAD they can’t do ANYTHING for you Jake"
2018-10-24 04:25:57+00:00,"Second driver cancelled today. “Wahin se aa raha hun. Wapas nahin jana.” Cancelled after making me wait, he had even reached the pickup point. Happening this for some days now. What’s up @Uber @Uber_Support @UberINSupport"
2018-10-24 03:26:36+00:00,Been doing a little research. You may want to consider filing a complaint with the @FTC. Could force @paypal to refund all payments taken by @uber 30+ days after ride. https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/identity-theft-and-data-security/filing-complaint
2018-10-24 02:53:41+00:00,I’m going to be honest. I laughed out loud when I read “does not include the trip back” 
2018-10-24 01:17:38+00:00,"In your trip feedback you have buttons for 'driving' 'professionalism', 'vehicle' etc where you can get quick feedback. Add a new feedback button 'no seatbelts'. You will get a lot of feedback"
2018-10-23 22:18:59+00:00,"forever dissapointed by @Uber &amp; @Uber_Support, u guys fuckin suck"
2018-10-23 20:35:30+00:00,&@Uber many thanks for charging me £4 for your driver cancelling when he hasn’t turned up and claims he was waiting over 5 minutes. Please note I even discussed the pick up location with him @Uber_Support @UberUKsupport
2018-10-23 20:11:44+00:00,That’s so bad of @UberEats Terrible not to take responsibility and try to make up for it! 
2018-10-23 19:07:31+00:00,So I ordered a uber from central London with 6% battery on my phone. It took me 3mins to walk to this driver but he is claiming uber cancelled me. @Uber_Support 
2018-10-23 18:57:19+00:00,"Wow, @UberEats - HORRIBLE customer service. You’d think a company would rather satisfy a customer &amp; lose a few $$knowing they’re have repeat business &amp; tell their friends. But instead choose greed &amp; lose customers &amp; potential $$$. You’ve lost my business. Too many better options"
2018-10-23 15:00:42+00:00,"Send us a DM actually means, this sort of thing happens all the time and we really don't want the public to know about it so let's talk behind closed doors. #DoorsAreAlwaysOpening"

2018-10-23 00:28:01+00:00,@Uber_Support this has been happening nearly daily. Getting real tired of not being able to access my money or even know what I made. 
2018-10-23 00:14:42+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support is there a chance I can get paid for the trips I’m making tonight? Gas is getting low!!! It’s getting ridiculous that I’m 12 trips and I’ve only been paid for 2 and my tips. #ineedmymoney #hungryneedfood #carneedsfoodtoo
2018-10-22 23:24:31+00:00,Hey @Uber_AZ @Uber_Support I’m not paying this bill. This is on you for not figuring this out until 3.5 months later. 
2018-10-22 23:22:52+00:00,1) This is my fault for still using @Uber @Uber_Support in July. I knew better. 2) WTF. 
2018-10-22 21:02:54+00:00,Pathetic conditions at KIAL Bangalore just now! @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India - why can’t your app let passengers know at the time of booking that cars are NOT available OR will take 45 minutes to show up if at all?!! Is India market not due the same SLA as elsewhere?? #FAIL
2018-10-22 20:28:26+00:00,Well I would have never set foot in an @Uber if I had known. But I was under the impression that Shanthihal was a company driver. Only after I realised he worked for @Uber. 12h and still no news or support from @UberUKsupport.
2018-10-22 19:31:13+00:00,w o w @Uber_Support my driver couldn't even reach the pedals so I had to help. how is this ok??

2018-10-22 14:35:04+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Wats the use of buying uber pass. Thats insane and unjust pricing... 
2018-10-22 14:23:39+00:00,I don't use @UberUK. It was the company and I will make sure they wont again in the future. This is utterly unprofessional.
2018-10-22 13:20:35+00:00,I hope that you are changing the locks of the door of your house...
2018-10-22 12:43:04+00:00,I forgot my key in an @Uber car and the company @Uber_Support has not been able to contact the driver in 4h to get my keys back. Utterly useless company I hope they lose their license in London!

2018-10-22 00:02:46+00:00,"Yup, instant pay has always worked for me until this weekend. I’ve now been sitting with no money and unable to drive because I can’t put gas in my car. I have a car payment due this week. All they keep saying is “we’re sorry and we’re working on it.” Which doesn’t help."

2018-10-21 04:59:45+00:00,"Terrible when you drop something in an @Uber, you reach out, and the driver refuses to help. Do better, @uber_support."
2018-10-21 04:50:34+00:00,"I believe referral codes only work for new accounts. Also, don’t you need a credit card or debit card to set up an account? Not everyone has a credit card or checking account."

2018-10-05 13:09:18+00:00,I have experienced it multiple times. Once driver started trip and ended it nearly same spot because I did not cancel and he did not want to go towards my destination. I complained twice and did not get refund too. This was like 4 months back @Uber_India
2018-10-05 12:59:10+00:00,I just had the same issue in Chennai. Driver said he can't come on PayTM and didn't cancel it either.
2018-10-05 07:02:10+00:00,Seriously @Uber DO NOT tell me off for riding on the road instead of one of those painted cycle paths. I know the path and your drivers constantly close pass on it. I take the lane. @UberAbdul @Uber_Support

This company’s policy of ignoring customers’ complaints is nasty. I’ll post a full thread of my ride and how my complaint was ignored.
2018-10-02 22:58:50+00:00,this is absurd. @Uber should be doing more to ensure customers are getting their belongings. @Uber_Support needs to step up and hold drivers accountable for their actions. your silence on this matter is basically saying drivers can just steal from their passengers. ridiculous
2018-10-02 21:56:33+00:00,@Uber_Support I was charged an $80 cleaning fee FOR THIS? My friends and I were NOT responsible for this. My driver was unreasonable from the start of the trip and unjustly claimed a cleaning fee just to spite me. As a loyal Uber customer for 2 years I would like this solved ASAP 
2018-10-02 17:09:48+00:00,Guess how long it takes? Since the problem still hasn’t been resolved your guess is as good as mine. @Uber @Uber_Support your service is a joke.

2018-10-01 14:51:33+00:00,@Uber and @Uber_Support has no respect for disabled riders. A driver broke my mobility device a few days ago and they refuse to pay for the damage. They think a refund of a $15 ride is enough compensation for a repair that will cost significantly more than $15. We deserve better.
2018-10-01 14:32:38+00:00,"So check this out... took an @Uber trip, lost the phone in the uber, driver claimed he didn’t find the phone. Then randomly the phone makes an uber trip to Orlando for no reason. SAME DRIVER. Wtf? @Uber_Support this needs to be fixed and the driver needs charges pressed. "
2018-10-01 14:07:26+00:00,. @Uber_Support is there anyway you can add a function where it lets the driver know if we’re open to having a conversation or not because idk how to tell them that I don’t want to talk without them taking it the wrong way. I just simply don’t want to talk.
2018-10-01 13:16:37+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber @UberEats - unsatisfactory response. Refunding my money and investigating is not enough? What about the hardworking people @DCRapeCrisis who had their day ruined by your driver when my colleagues &amp; I were trying to thank them? FIX. THIS.

2018-09-16 03:08:09+00:00,I hope @Uber plans on paying my overdraft fees since my #UberInstantPay hasn’t worked for DAYS. My checking account is over drawn &amp; I’m going to bed HUNGRY every night cuz I have no $for food or gas!! @Uber_Support I bet the CEO isn’t going to bed hungry #UNACCEPTABLE
2018-09-16 01:50:26+00:00,#uberinstantpay @Uber_Support they have no intention of paying us until Tuesday they answer is right in front your face 
2018-09-16 01:37:20+00:00,"@Uber_Support PAY ME!!! I haven’t been paid in 7 days, you keep telling me 24-48 hrs, It’s been a week I have no gas and no food and I haven’t been able to pay my kids daycare! This is unacceptable @Uber @Uber_Support doesn’t even care about drivers!"
2018-09-16 01:23:39+00:00,@Uber_Support when they say 1-2 hours or a few hours and it’s going onto Day 3 lol #uberpay #instantpay #uber @Uber
2018-09-16 00:57:03+00:00,I've been driving in the hurricane all day but I ran out of gas because I was counting on @uber_support to pay their drivers as per the written agreement. @uber abandoned their responsibility and I got abandoned on the side of the road in the storm.Luckily a Good Samaritan helped
2018-09-16 00:55:38+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support stuck at home with no gas. Ubers been disfunctional all weekend. Cant access our pay. Cant eat. Cant drive.
2018-09-15 23:36:50+00:00,You just write the same thing over and over. Drivers deserve answers. This is sloppy and lazy.
2018-09-15 23:12:40+00:00,@tech5960 @luckylucy061752Ive @Uber_Support I've been getting this error notice since 8pm last night I cannot continue not getting paid this must end IMMEDIATELY.. If you cant fix Instant Pay start sending cash to drivers via PAYPAL until this EMBARRASSING SITUATION gets fixed! 
2018-09-15 22:31:37+00:00,Simple maths for #uber withholding $millions to pay debts threatening foreclosure? #uber is losing $billions drivers are of least concern bankruptcy beckons ominous signs look for blank screens &amp; #uber office boarded up This is a familiar scenario
2018-09-15 21:13:42+00:00,@Uber_Support ima need this instant pay to start workin please ..
2018-09-15 19:34:52+00:00,@Uber_Support it has been 5 hours since I've tried to get my instant pay to work. It says it should be up in 1-2 hours. What is the deal?
2018-09-15 19:34:48+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support we are your drivers who help you become a billion dollar company. We DEMAND a substantial credit to all of our accounts for the strain, pain and suffering this is causing us! $100 credit minimum because drivers have gone days without money"
2018-09-15 18:39:59+00:00,@Uber_Support when will instant pay start working? It's been saying 1-2 hours for two days now. I'm without gas and losing money in the meantime. Drivers should stop driving until this is fixed. Lyft's payment system is working.
2018-09-15 18:39:31+00:00,@Uber_Support in all of the automated responses you’ve said the instant pay issue would resolve itself in a few hours. Just curious has anyone had their instant pay restored? Can we get a little more info then the same three responses you’ve been pedaling for the past few days?
2018-09-15 18:37:56+00:00,@Uber_Support I have lost so much money the last couple of days because of all of the Instant Pay issues. I was left without gas because I couldn't get paid. I'm done with Uber. 2 year driver over 1400 rides 4.93 start driver. Goodbye.
2018-09-15 18:37:02+00:00,@CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC @thehill @NBCNews @ABC Uber hasn’t paid drivers for going on 4 days now. New driver app not functioning to show fares and pay drivers. Time to inform national media since Uber is non responsive. On hold 45 minutes now for phone support. Pay drivers!
2018-09-15 18:16:32+00:00,@Uber_Support @uber @nytimes @NBCConnecticut @NBCNews One to two hours has turned into days. Everything else is working on your site except instant pay...so you're making money but we aren't. #boycottuber #boycott #instantpay #uberdriver
2018-09-15 17:27:01+00:00,So @Uber_Support answer me this. The reason the instant pay issue hasn’t been resolved is because there’s a Typhoon happening in the Philippines so no one is there to fix the problem? And if that’s the case WHY TF WOULDN’T YOU HAVE BACKUP HERE IN THE STATES?
2018-09-15 17:17:35+00:00,"Did @Uber run out of cash like Moviepass and that's why they can't pay drivers??!! @Uber_Support Rides still processing(not available), Instant Pay still broken. #VentureCapital"
2018-09-15 16:45:08+00:00,"@Uber_Support it's funny that these issues never affect the rider app. All of your ""glitches"" seem to affect driver pay every time. This is ridiculous. This is how we live."
2018-09-15 16:27:13+00:00,@Uber_Support when will instant pay get fixed!?!? I have a 2 year old who needs food and diapers. The whole reason I worked last night was to get food and diapers today but I can’t even get my money! Help!!!
2018-09-15 15:27:58+00:00,@Uber_Support when are you going to get instant pay and earnings fixed. It’s unacceptable that a Tech company can have these types of issues. PAY THE DRIVERS NOW!!!!!!!!
2018-09-15 15:26:25+00:00,@Uber @UberEats @Uber_Support should have kept its old app for drivers. Another example of trying to be too fancy in tech. Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. #DriverUberBoycott until instant pay is back working!
2018-09-15 13:19:00+00:00,So you lot have been saying by auto-reply for HOURS (days for some) from what I've read and the app/website say 1-2hrs. No instant pay means I can't work. I knew things were gonna go bad with a new app but c'mon
2018-09-15 13:12:50+00:00,"@Uber_Support hey folks, do you have an time estimate to when the instant pay issue will be fixed?"
2018-09-15 05:46:36+00:00,"@Uber_Support your new driver app is pure trash. Earnings error. Don't know what I've made at all,all night. Cancellations still not showing up. And app is losing my location constantly. NAV Freezes. Zone in's are not centered. No logic to the app. Just trash. 2+ year vet driver."
2018-09-15 05:37:36+00:00,@Uber_Support instant pay hasn't worked for me the last 3 Fridays. only on Friday.. drove 15 trips tonight and shows $0 earned. very frustrating. shouldn't have this problem with a new app 
2018-09-15 04:44:03+00:00,.@Uber_Support @Uber will you ever solve the problem? Sending screenshots of the issue here. You guys are not responding to emails anyways. I wish to delete the account now. Just asking to refund what you owe me!
2018-09-15 03:59:14+00:00,I’m well aware of that. I’m addressing the issue of integrity. When the error message reads it will be fixed in 1-2 hours that lacks integrity.
2018-09-15 03:51:20+00:00,You’ve said this for seven hours. I take great pride in performing my job as an Uber partner with integrity. Why not release a statement on Twitter honestly addressing the issue instead of a canned response to each tweet?
2018-09-15 02:09:03+00:00,"Hey @Uber, I think it’d be pretty neat if I knew how much I was earning - been online for 4 hours tonight and this still isn’t fixed. Just a thought! @Uber_Support "
2018-09-15 01:00:56+00:00,If we were any drunker i believe that he would have tried to take us elsewhere. Drink safe and be safe y’all! @Uber_Support
2018-09-15 00:07:54+00:00,This is some fuckin bullshit @Uber_Support. How much longer is Instant Pay gonna be down? It’s been much longer than 1-2 hours as the app states. When tf will I be able to cash tf out????????
2018-09-14 23:27:26+00:00,24 hours and no instant pay available. @Uber_Support I need my money. Im now stuck in the middle of no where.
2018-09-14 23:26:52+00:00,"Okay @Uber..looks like it’s time to delete you app as your @Uber_Support is completely ignoring my requests to change my phone number in the account..it’s been almost two weeks, it’s ridiculous. Why would I keep the app if I can’t use it? @lyft it is."
2018-09-14 22:51:47+00:00,"Forget instant pay... We can't even see what we have earned! Seriously... Fix the processing problem! We don't work for free, and it is hard to know if we have met our goals if we can't see what we have done. This is the MOST BASIC function of the app for drivers!"
2018-09-14 22:51:03+00:00,@Uber_Support how long until Cash Out is fixed on the driver app?
2018-09-14 21:10:05+00:00,I really wish @Uber @Uber_Support would fix this issue with earnings not loading 
2018-09-14 20:17:57+00:00,@Uber_Support I’ve had an earnings error update on my account for several days. Now my instant pay is unavailable. Can someone please get back to me with what the issue is? Is it an app-wide issue or is this the n a driver by driver basis??
2018-09-14 19:40:45+00:00,"ATTENTION DRIVERS!!!!! You may want to wait until uber has their instant pay fixed to drive. Their system has been having major issues for 3 days now in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area! Support cannot give an answer as to what the issue is and when it will be resolved."
2018-09-14 19:36:17+00:00,"Quick question! My @Uberuk driver was a no-show and I was still charged as if the ride had happened! @Uber_Support says that, due to my history, they believe I went on this particular trip. Just wondering how frequent is this, pls let me know if this has happened 2 U. Thanks!"
2018-09-14 17:38:22+00:00,Why can’t Uber drivers tip the riders? @Uber_Support
2018-09-14 17:22:23+00:00,So @Uber_Support @Uber has ZERO CONSIDERATION that a blind person can not walk to the nearest point on the map cause we can’t see it. So we just get to pay an extra $20-30 round trip to take a regular pool. Which is $2 less than an x now?! ADA violation anyone?
2018-09-14 14:28:42+00:00,Blown away that I got a call at 1 AM from my sister telling me that her @Uber driver kicked her and her boyfriend out of the car and left them on the side of the road. Definitely will not be getting our money from here on out. @Uber_Support
2018-09-14 06:44:57+00:00,I’ve deleted the App. Too many times ended up paying over the odds for a journey - that’s if they actually turned up at all. Now use @Gett_UK instead.
2018-09-14 06:28:30+00:00,"It happens all the time @Uber_Support it’s the reason I stopped using you. I use a local firm which also has an app and lets you pay by card, for a better rate."
2018-09-14 06:22:16+00:00,"Delete the app; you'll like yourself more for not rewarding a company which gets rich dodging taxes, evading worker protections (and misleading you)."
2018-09-14 01:48:17+00:00,Anyone in the Boston area having trouble with their @UberEats @Uber @Uber_Support accounts with trips not be processed since yesterday?Also are you able to cash out with instant pay from @gobank right away? My trips are not being processed at all and I am getting very impatient!
2018-09-14 01:35:38+00:00,"@Uber_Support my driver last night pushed me out of the moving car and drove away screaming “YO BEST BET”, this was her "
2018-09-13 15:44:28+00:00,I was going to write a scathing tweet to @Uber_Support because my route makes no sense but then the driver started playing The Beatles that reminds me of my Dad and I am crying and feeling like it’s not the end of the world to be in the car 40 minutes longer than you need to.
2018-09-13 14:09:50+00:00,Nowadays all ur driver partners ask passengers about the destination points before even picking them up and also asking them to cancel if locations are not preferable. Isn’t it unprofessionalism @Uber_Support @UberINSupport ?&amp; this is not specific to late evngs
2018-09-13 13:17:27+00:00,"FYI - even though they are “sorry to hear” about my disgusting ride, they won’t refund my fare. @uber and @Uber_Support provide the absolute worst customer service. "
2018-09-13 13:15:50+00:00,They actually just called me to investigate and credited my account 
2018-09-13 12:52:40+00:00,WHAT. Can he be reported to @Uber_Support ? That absolutely is not okay.
2018-09-13 11:51:32+00:00,"'It happens all the time'? In what other scenario would you tolerate this shit service? My guess is, you wouldn't! And it's nothing to do with convenience either, is it Jezza? You obviously love a cheap human being, you just wouldn't want to be one yourself eh?"
2018-09-13 09:32:27+00:00,Thanks @Uber_BOS @Uber for not even refunding me my ride when I reported the car smelled so bad I will have to get my jacket dry cleaned. It’s as if you want everyone to switch to @lyft congrats! It worked. #uberfail @Uber_Support
2018-09-13 05:55:32+00:00,I’d drive that route everyday if I could 
2018-09-13 05:02:45+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support please do something about your navigation system and teach your drivers to just bloody CALL the passenger if they get lost and can't find the location... I just spent 20 minutes screaming into the phone because mt driver couldn't find me..
2018-09-13 03:14:37+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support We need a proper pickup location at midfield. 2580 Britannia Rd E is a valid pickup point. The route though is highly illegal. I believe @TorontoPearson would not allow the crossing of a #runway and multiple #taxiways We need to get this fixed #avgeek
2018-09-13 02:25:29+00:00,The fact that you can never immediately get in touch with @Uber_Support except through the convoluted options on their app is one of the most infuriating things about the whole thing. 
2018-09-13 00:45:44+00:00,"I’ve been through this before, you send me to an automated email that doesn’t help at all and then I get frustrated and give up, I’m good"
2018-09-12 20:26:38+00:00,I just need @Uber_Support to actually call me back so we can resolve this.
2018-09-12 18:55:14+00:00,Use a black cab?
2018-09-12 18:54:41+00:00,.@Uber &amp; @Uber_Support have made such a big fuss recently about their renewed “dedication to their partners.” I’ve been offline THREE weeks because they can’t review an insurance card &amp; registration... or apparently know the partners name they’re addressing. #Fail #ChooseLyft
2018-09-12 18:04:56+00:00,A friend of mine was robbed by her @Uber @Uber_Support Driver. They’ve told her they’re at the mercy of police and there’s nothing they can do. I believe that to be a steaming pile of HorseDookie. @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC I think 1 of u should look into how Uber treats driver theft
2018-09-12 15:25:55+00:00,"YET AGAIN, I end up late and waiting 10 minutes for an Uber that never shows up. Happy that I get to pay for a second Uber that’s double the price. Hi @Uber_Support, I want a refund x2 or the original price honored. I’ll email you the screenshots rn! Thnx"

2018-09-09 05:51:46+00:00,I called on my number and after a few calls he picked up and eventually came back from almost Andheri to Chembur to give me my phone. God bless him and the good folks at @Uber! #Uber absolutely rocks! Thank you @Uber_Support for the late night offer to help ad well.

2018-09-03 20:57:04+00:00,Bag and credit card were stolen and used by this Uber driver. Reached out to them multiple times and no response. No wonder Uber has such a bad rep they have awful customer service @Uber @Uber_Support

2018-09-02 23:52:48+00:00,Absolutely ridiculous experience (not the first time for early morning flight!!!) On #Uber when the driver either cancels or switchesoff his phone abruptly and doesn't cancels the trip. #Uber sud compensate for tension caused @Uber_India @Uber @Uber_Support
2018-09-02 21:52:49+00:00,My phone was literally stolen by an Uber driver and @Uber_Support can’t get back to me. What the f*ck. @Uber

2018-09-02 15:23:10+00:00,I never ever do this but @Uber_Support and @Uber have maybe the worst ever most unthorough customer service I’ve ever experienced.
2018-09-02 12:39:32+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support how come if I cancel I get charged but when your drivers make me wait ten minutes and then unexpectedly cancel there’s no compensation? Love that
2018-09-02 11:14:52+00:00,Uber uber everywhere.. Except when customer service is needed. I have been waiting for weeks for a solution and no one is taking my issue seriously. Credit card is getting used with no security control and no serious answer. @Uber_Support @Uber #uberfail

2018-08-29 03:38:30+00:00,And @Uber_Support hasn’t helped at all. All I get is refunded cancellation fees I should’ve never been charged.
2018-08-28 21:45:39+00:00,I think it’s ridiculous that they don’t have an actual customer service line that you can call. Everything is just over email & every single email that they send you is sent by a different person
2018-08-28 17:49:13+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support ... How many racist ""Michael""'s drive for you in Tallahassee? I'll use Uber again when I read that this driver has been i.d.'d &amp; fired. Not before. "

2018-08-24 18:17:18+00:00,Edward that is a automated response they don’t give a toss
2018-08-24 18:08:25+00:00,.@Uber_Support your drivers asking for destination pre-trip and then canceling when you don't respond is a poor show

2018-08-22 04:54:54+00:00,"Of course.. what I think is that they charge over 35%of the fare from all drivers also as their charge i.e if you pay RS. 100 to driver them Rs. 35 goes to these thugs and that's why they are not willing to give refunds... that's why I say ""PARTNERS IN CRIME"""

2018-08-19 08:42:48+00:00,"Thank @uber_support! Your feed is absolutely the funniest thing on twitter. @dkhos you should give those guys a raise! Oh wait, they are probably just ""support partners"". In that case exploit away."
2018-08-19 08:30:07+00:00,Happens all day and every day Martin. I urge you to read the other things their drivers do. They’re not pleasant.
2018-08-19 07:31:40+00:00,The same has happened with me also... The driver was drunk and he refused to come on the location and also refusing to cancel the trip from his side.. Because of this I had to give cancellation charge on my next trip
2018-08-19 04:23:30+00:00,"I’m just kidding Uber it’s not that big of a deal, still love you"

2018-08-18 02:11:58+00:00,Hey @Uber did you get hacked? My cc associated with my Uber account was used for Uber Eats which I don’t have - my cc company says they have gotten dozens of calls reporting the exact same thing @Uber_Support

2018-08-17 12:56:25+00:00,Got my figures wrong yesterday but getting nowhere with @Uber_Support Here's my daughter receipt for a north London trip that should be about £20.

2018-08-17 12:13:36+00:00,I’m all about principle and customer service and when a company fails to honour that. I will discontinue use completely. You guys have terrible customer service @Uber_Support and I’m not shocked that everyone’s making the switch to Lyft.

2018-08-17 04:50:26+00:00,"So sorry you went through that! Hope @Uber_Support actually does something for once. They‘re likely to put you through endless forms &amp; emails to try and get you to give up. If you don’t have the emotional energy, that is more than understandable. Others are fighting for you! "
2018-08-17 01:11:14+00:00,"Press won’t touch Uber. Advertising money’s holding all of them hostage, I remember reading that Uber had a team whose only job was to track reporters who gave them bad press and then try to get them fired. The press is in bed with Uber."

2018-08-16 16:01:57+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Either I'm missing something or there's a HUGE flaw in your system. I left my phone in a car yesterday &amp; I'm currently trying to get it back.

2018-08-16 15:11:47+00:00,"Wow guys this seems to have become a daily scam for you guys ? Today again your driver started the trip then cancelled the same and left , and now I have to pay for a trip I never took ! What is this going on @Uber_Support"
2018-08-16 13:03:04+00:00,@uber_support do you expect your drivers to love you and work for you when you take 70 percent of fares? This is OUTRAGEOUS @cnbc let's get some press on this.

2018-07-30 04:47:43+00:00,Uber driver looks at me and says he doesnt like me in his car and refuses to take me home and it all boils down to race. This is america. #racistuber #discrimation #blacklivesmatter #uber @Uber @Uber_Support

2018-07-29 18:48:13+00:00,An Uber is basically a stranger in a car. Think hitch hiking but paying.

2018-07-29 17:51:11+00:00,Smh @Uber_Support yeah I’m gonna need a refund this is out of hand 
2018-07-29 16:00:03+00:00,Downloaded your app first time and deleted in 10 mins. 2 reasons for it @Uber @Uber_Support @uber 1) it's imposing a language which I can't understand. 2) I could not find option to change language. So it's not user friendly. #ServeInMyLanguage #poorservice

I prefer Women Muslim Drivers specially FACING Triple Talaq frm Muslim husbands
2018-07-28 04:36:18+00:00,They won't. They will just inundate your inbox with mails and tell you they couldnt identify such an incident and in the end ask you to report in app.( which you would have already) and then disappear.

2018-07-27 21:43:18+00:00,"My @Uber driver just suggested that I get out of the car and take the bus home because he doesn’t want to sit in traffic. Next, he asked me how much the ride cost and then said that the price was too high. What are your thoughts @Uber_Support?"

2018-07-27 17:22:30+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support you need to take care of this driver and update the receipt. I was dropped at Vasant Kunj and now I see the driver has stopped the ride at the airport. Since the payment had to be paid through card i was cheated.

2018-07-27 08:19:56+00:00,"So @Uber @Uber_Support drivers consistently cancel my trips... and @Lyft @AskLyft is just more consistent- deleted Uber before.

2018-07-27 00:43:35+00:00,I will like to appreciate @Uber_Support for being very responsive to customer complain. There has been no time I registered a complain that Idon't have resolution within hrs. #keepitup @eagleaitaylor @soluchybaroness

2018-07-26 16:39:53+00:00,Disgusting reason by my @Uber dropping me halfway en route my destination saying it’s a Muslim area and he will not go beyond the point. I’m not seeking for attention but I’ve never been this agitated by a person in my life. Now I understand what #racism means! @Uber_Support

2018-07-26 05:00:19+00:00,@Uber_India @Uber_Support Your driver just tried to take me through the back road to Bangalore Airport to avoid the toll - the same excuse &amp; route taken when the woman was molested by another cab driver. Why the hell aren’t you guys seriously reprimanding your drivers? Ridiculous
2018-07-26 03:38:07+00:00,Hello can I have my phone back @Uber_Support
2018-07-25 23:20:59+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support why can't I file a complaint on the driver who cancelled on me (during a rain storm) AFTER he called to see where I was going (against your policies)?? It doesn't show that he cancelled in my app or allow me to notify you so you can track these things.
2018-07-25 22:27:06+00:00,Seeing articles on #uberfraud @Uber @Uber_Support I’m not surprised. I was charged $150 in @Disney for something I didn’t do. #uber won’t refund money.

2018-07-25 07:39:36+00:00,LOL @Uber_Support ran out of randomized autoresponses. 
2018-07-25 07:11:52+00:00,"Ok @Uber_Support, you won. I sent over twenty messages in over two weeks to solve this. You told me a driver confirmed he found my lost item. Nice. You told me he reached out to me. Not true. Since then autoresponses and now nothing for a couple of days. GG"
2018-07-25 07:10:11+00:00,It's quite stupid that @Uber_Support allows its drivers to start the trip before before picking us up. This has happened thrice in 2 days for me and all three times in Mumbai. OLA with its OTP system negates this issue completely

2018-07-20 03:51:45+00:00,They don’t care. Any 20 minute long pick up is a total waste of time and money. The whole gig isn’t worth it under the current slave-like system.

2018-07-10 09:38:35+00:00,"So @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_RSA you guys don’t plan on giving my back my R515 that you debited twice. I’m asking this because I am tired of sending emails so I want you to just tell me to forget about it, bloody frauds. pic.twitter.com/hcghexFTQn"
2018-07-10 08:49:44+00:00,Saw a @NissanEV_UK Leaf with an @Uber sign on it. I would really like to be able to choose a electric vehicle for my ride. Or even a @ToyotaGB hybrid as in Sheffield it seems most @Uber are diesel. When will I be able to do this @Uber_Support ?
2018-07-10 08:09:34+00:00,@Hatewatch @ADL_National I think @dkhos &amp; @uber need sensitivity training! Uber slashed the drivers rates so now this is the garbage that runs around picking up riders! The response from @Uber_Support show ZERO understanding! Maybe calling for a 24 hour #BoycottUber is needed?
2018-07-10 07:13:09+00:00,Dear @Uber @Uber_Support! If your drivers will cancel trips on hearing the destination (even if you have boarded the cab after waiting for it to come for more than 15 mins). You should share the destination upfront with the drivers or have a penalty structure #MumbaiRains #stuck
2018-07-10 06:40:09+00:00,@Uber_Support Your service is the worst. I have not received two receipt for two trips that i had three weeks ago and asked dozens of times and still got no answer. Plus my account still doesnt work and I am not getting any support. I will delete my account and not use Uber again
2018-07-10 05:49:41+00:00,"@Uber_India, @Uber_Support I was talking about the same thing. I have taken 3 screenshots of the booking sequence. Please don’t waste our valuable time with your sucking logic of waiting. This is definitely pushing me to @Olacabs. pic.twitter.com/GYfKhvfX7d"
2018-07-10 04:44:42+00:00,"One of your drivers stole my wallet which had my ID, my navy federal debit card, and $100 in it and I've tried emailing and reporting through the app w/ no response from the driver or the support team Bad way to treat a customer who has been w/ you for years @Uber @Uber_Support"
2018-07-10 04:41:18+00:00,The looting spree continuing unabated.. no takers.

2018-07-10 01:16:54+00:00,The policy of crediting accounts when your app/drivers make mistakes is HORRIBLE. Not only do I have to pay for my actual ride but I have EXTRA money “credited” on my account as some time of incentive when it’s an unfair & business move for your mistake. @Uber_Support

2018-07-09 05:50:24+00:00,Since there is little or no competition both @ola_supports @Olacabs and @Uber @Uber_Support are fleecing commuters. This is happening in all cities. All long as the government doesn't rein in these cab aggregators they will continue to cheat people. @nitin_gadkari
2018-07-09 05:48:17+00:00,Hey @Uber_India @Uber_Support how can I complain about a driver who had kept application on and could not be reached at 5am for an airport ride. Even after cancellation was getting the assigned the very same driver. Your options for complaints do not consider this scenario
2018-07-09 04:44:21+00:00,Hi @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber_Mumbai it’s good to see that cab services have got our backs in this weather. All I need is to pay almost 7 times the fare to get to work in pouring rain. Great job!
2018-07-09 04:37:43+00:00,"Two locations in South Delhi less than 10 kms apart. @Uber charges fare by crossing Yamuna, adding UP toll taxes and some other fictional breakups. Amusing new low in already declining services. @Uber_Support @Uber_India"
2018-07-09 02:44:41+00:00,@Dev_Fadnavis @MumbaiPolice @CPMumbaiPolice The normal fare from Thane to Mahalaxmi is max Rs 600/- See they are demanding more than Rs 1500/- is there no control on @Uber ? They are allowed to take advantage of the situation of heavy rain?? @Uber_Support 
2018-07-08 21:57:25+00:00,Notify @Uber @Uber_Support of his unethical methods so other customers don’t fall victim to his actions. Good on @mikesaffaie ‘s sister for navigating the vehicle during that chaos!
2018-07-08 20:11:04+00:00,USKOXKWIXJIS WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
2018-07-08 16:10:06+00:00,This great news. Take note @amazon @Uber_Support @AskLyft @Deliveroo
2018-07-08 11:46:40+00:00,@Uber_Support I usually never complain because it’s never that deep but this driver didnt signal when changing lanes on the dual carriageway and nearly crashed. I am NOT paying for this.
2018-07-08 11:31:52+00:00,@Uber_Support I’m having the worst journey in my life. There is absolutely no way in hell I’m paying for this trip I’m honestly disgusted
2018-07-08 10:07:35+00:00,"Same with @Uber_Support They ""trasfer"" the ride to other drivers after 10min. Driver1-&gt;Driver2-&gt;Driver3 and so on. Finally you wait for an hour or pay cancellation charges "
2018-07-08 08:56:15+00:00,"Why have all @Uber drivers started asking where I want to go when I book. If you want to question me before I sit, please become a rickshaw driver @Uber_Support"
2018-07-08 05:53:51+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support can anyone explain why this driver has been waiting close to 15minutes &amp; has me &amp; another passenger waiting then we get charged time and distance. Now he still wants to try to do a U-turn to look for this person. We GOT PLACES TO BE!! 
2018-07-08 05:31:02+00:00,This happened to me too. I was unable to use Uber for months. My account was hacked by someone in Russia. The @Uber team was beyond unhelpful. Good luck!
2018-07-08 02:12:39+00:00,"So glad @Uber is taking care of this. ""This appears to be a legitimate trip [on your hacked account]. Until you pay for the trip(s) [people took all over the country on your account within a 24 hour period] you will not be able to request a ride."" #deleteuber @Uber_Support "
2018-07-08 00:43:46+00:00,Let’s all help Uber read. What number is this?
2018-07-08 00:41:31+00:00,"It’s time to start using the local taxis again and truly embracing the local economy. Uber is contrary to your values, so why use them?"
2018-07-08 00:40:13+00:00,"Update on the @Uber saga. @Uber_Support is claiming they refunded the $20. I have showed them my Amex statement (twice) showing a credit of only $5. They do not seem good at reading. Again, all money received with be X100 and given to Puerto Rican relief."
2018-07-08 00:35:39+00:00,I’ll restore my account if you make this real @Uber_Support 
2018-07-08 00:14:04+00:00,"Apparently, the Missus & I have used @Uber so often, they've made our address (house) a ""Common pick up spot"". From a safety &amp; security standpoint (of my OWN property), I'm not sure I really like this. Not a fan of drivers/passengers waiting in front of my house. @Uber_Support"
2018-07-07 21:41:16+00:00,100% just lost faith in Uber. It's time that I find me a full time job with benefits! It was fun while it lasted! @dkhos @Uber @Uber_Support #Uber #fedup #DONE

2018-07-07 20:11:20+00:00,.@Uber_Support sucks so bad. I’ve tried to tip my drivers the last three days and it’s still having issues. Way to cheat your drivers and make the rider look awful.
2018-07-07 17:54:50+00:00,he got back in the car.. sorry for the inconvenience
2018-07-07 17:41:48+00:00,@Uber_Support i was in an uber and my driver just got out of the car and ran off?? how do i get my refund ??? 
2018-07-07 16:43:07+00:00,"They don’t know “who I am,” and that’s good. Their terrible customer service should be points out. I will gladly amplify disputes with them."
2018-07-07 16:34:42+00:00,"Remember, it took nearly three weeks for @Uber_Support to agree to refund the $20 they tried to abscond with and then they only actually refunded $5. What are the odds the new @Uber actually coughs up the missing $15? (All $will by X100 and donated to Puerto Rican relief.)"
2018-07-07 16:17:18+00:00,"To recap the story about the new, more customer-friendly @Uber, they added $20 to a fare claiming CA134 was a toll road (it isn’t). It took weeks of complaints to get them to agree to a refund — but they only refunded $5 ($500 given so far to Puerto Rican relief)."
2018-07-07 16:13:38+00:00,"By the way, @Uber and @Uber_Support never did refund the $15 they owed me. It will still be multiplied by 100 and given to Puerto Rico relief if I ever get it."
2018-07-07 13:26:04+00:00,"@UfterYou @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_India A ridiculous driver took money and abandoned my parents in rain, &amp; cancelled the trip - and @Uber_Support is just as ridiculous and thieving as its driver - NO SUPPORT NO RESPONSE I HV FILED A POLICE COMPLAINT"
2018-07-07 13:24:52+00:00,Cheers @Uber_Support four drivers cancelled and counting. I can only imagine it's because it's a short trip. But custom is custom. Shame it doesn't affect their star rating. Stranded. 
2018-07-07 07:48:10+00:00,"Dear @Uber_Support - this is a bit creepy to email me this. I only opened the app to look at the “help”’section while at Heathrow, I never made a request or even typed in an address. If you are going to email me surveys, at least base it on me making a failed car request. "
2018-07-07 03:29:58+00:00,"Uber have to give the compensation to you even the car number is also mentioned , if they didnt take any action then this will be very shamefull @Uber_Support "
2018-07-06 20:33:12+00:00,Lol good luck w/that one! I was scammed for throwing up in an uber & charged $150 for going 4 blocks! They never resolved as promised & now Im a @lyft only gal :)
2018-07-06 20:26:54+00:00,I'm about to fire off a similar tweet to @Uber_Support except there's really no way to talk to an actual person when they charge you $340ish after your driver decides to continue cruising around LA for an hour or so after he drops you off
2018-07-06 18:13:19+00:00,"Every time I use @UberUK now, the time it suggests the cab will take to arrive bears no relation to the time once you confirm. And when you cancel you get charged. Time to delete? @Uber_Support"

2018-07-05 14:35:03+00:00,The response received was unhelpful and unacceptable. Continued to be surprised by the awful customer service and processes of @Uber @Uber_Support .

2018-07-05 00:45:13+00:00,we waited TWELVE minutes for our @Uber_Support to park in front of us and then cancel the trip before we could cross the a very busy six lane road and she never made any kind of attempt to contact us. this is why I’m strictly #TeamLyft
2018-07-04 23:39:53+00:00,Yea. I’m about to delete it once we get our money back. @Uber_Support your response was inadequate. We are awaiting a refund.
2018-07-04 22:20:59+00:00,@lyft this is horrid. #lyft drivers need to know what a scam this is.
2018-07-04 21:44:17+00:00,Been trying to get ahold of an Uber rep all day over an issue I had too. Their support is literally ran by robots. They have no intention on helping out clients 
2018-07-04 18:34:53+00:00,What was it? Unfortunately Uber also charges a $25 lost item fee so if it wasn’t worth that amount it’s unfortunately just gone. Found that out the hard way getting back a $10 phone battery.
2018-07-04 18:32:01+00:00,argh no! hope you’re able to get your stuff back!
2018-07-04 18:26:19+00:00,"We've gone through my friends ""rides"" to ""help"" to ""lost item"" and tried to contact the driver but that didn't work so then we left a message on the account. Waiting HOURS now for them to call us. But with Lyft you can just immediately call the driver. Uber doesn't let you."
2018-07-04 18:23:02+00:00,Ok @Uber &amp; @Uber_Support is trash. There's no contact for a lost item if you weren't the one ordering the Uber. My friend ordered Uber through their account &amp; I rode with them. I've lost an item &amp; can't contact the driver myself. Fact: you can contact @lyft drivers for lost items
2018-07-04 16:41:57+00:00,I booked an Uber and was waiting at my pickup location. The Uber was few kilometers away and the driver started the ride and began going in some random direction. I cancelled my ride and was still charged a hefty cancellation fee. @Uber_India @Uber_Support
2018-07-04 12:21:38+00:00,"But @Uber y’all got to do better. My first Uber cancelled on me because she couldn’t get to the Uber Zone (nice idea btw). Then y’all charge me $36 for an Uber ride back home that normally is $15 I had the best driver, but y’all are wild for the price @Uber_Support"
2018-07-04 10:15:38+00:00,Beware people if UBER service.They will cheat you in name of toll charge and they dont have any control on their drivers.

2018-07-02 23:26:37+00:00,"they've done this tons of times to me, esp when ive ended up in vocally transphobic/homophobic/verbally & physically unsafe rides! they just say ""it's not their policy to refund"" or ""they'll review it"" and mark it as solved!"
2018-07-02 17:31:49+00:00,That pretty much sums up uber's policy of listening to their drivers.
2018-07-02 04:46:41+00:00,@Uber_Support worst service for uber eats. It doesn't accept digital money. You have to keep physical cash with you. They are charging extra money. Worst app experience

2018-07-02 01:39:12+00:00,I asked this question about whether @Uber allows women 2 request a female driver because in many cases it's far safer &amp; #Uber has been advertising about their new safety features. I also should have included @Lyft in the tweet. Women should have the option 4 safety. @Uber_Support

2018-06-29 18:55:19+00:00,Why is a driver with 4.4 rating a VIP driver? He should not be driving at all. He was very disrespectful and put me off at the wrong destination. He told me to shut up and let him drive. @Uber @Uber_Support

2018-06-28 19:50:50+00:00,"Uber is garbage, the new CEO is worse. I wasn’t even sure that was possible. Driving uber has never been as bad as it is now."
2018-06-28 19:42:13+00:00,"Their maps are a mess, always canceling rides & getting lost. Garbage customer service"
2018-06-28 19:41:06+00:00,@Uber needs to sort their shit out
2018-06-28 15:06:40+00:00,Time for @Uber_India @Olacabs @MeruCabs to start cab services in #belgaum in #northkarnataka. Hiring an auto without standard fares is utter pain. @Uber @Uber_Support @ola_supports @allaboutbelgaum
2018-06-28 12:01:48+00:00,"Why not a taxi, at least the rate doesn’t change while you’re riding in the cab we recommend our local @WaterlooTaxi to all our customers ."
2018-06-28 06:33:38+00:00,Maybe if you actually had a customer service system in place this wouldn't be so ridiculous
2018-06-28 03:26:40+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support Yes ! You have a procedure to book a cab but in an medical emergency or in such cases make an easy/instant option for folks to avail a Cab, Hope Team UBER is listening @OdishaNews_Live @NwztodayNews @AdvocateKar"
2018-06-28 02:04:20+00:00,Because he choose the route on google that showed the highest mileage. And as uber run a meter through gps this will give the driver the most money.
2018-06-28 00:46:18+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support @ridesharepay So instead of surging the airport lot where we sit at in the queue, you surge the runway @CLTAirport . So right now your charging pax a surge price but not paying drivers the surge. It’s always a glitch in your favor. Good job"
2018-06-27 17:37:12+00:00,"Hey, can we talk about this? Uber have charged me for 70+ payments in the last week when I've taken only 3 rides. They aren't responding to my concerns and I'm hundreds of £s out of pocket - trying to see if this is a pattern."

2018-06-27 12:50:17+00:00,If @Uber_PKR @Uber_Support do not handle my query and get that driver accountable I will take it to their head office. This kind of rip off service in a country like ours will NOT be okay where jaahil drivers can curse us and still roam free.
2018-06-27 08:39:52+00:00,"No way! Come on @UberEats, not acceptable!"
2018-06-27 06:30:16+00:00,Shame on you @Uber_Support @Uber_India @UberINSupport inspite of multiple reminder thru ur App and Social Media you guys do not think it important to respond to a customers compliant! This is how you cheat your customers! #ShameOnUber
2018-06-27 05:06:30+00:00,"I totally agree. Had a pathetic experience contacting @Uber_Support @Uber_India after multiple tweets, messages."
2018-06-27 04:52:12+00:00,"@Uber_India @Uber You are colluding with a criminal by not sharing the detail with Police proactively. And on top of that, you have the audacity to fool around with people by issuing ambiguous, diplomatic comment!! Have some shame, and stop being a criminal cab service."
2018-06-27 04:42:14+00:00,"No, Uber has NOT helped the authorities with the identity of the woman yet because if they would’ve I’d have been informed first. @Uber_Support, pls stop with your robotic genetic statements &amp; actually do what is needed to be done. "
2018-06-27 02:32:33+00:00,"Now every time I watch the #worldcup on my phone app and the @imVkohli advert for @Uber plays, this is what I’ll be thinking about. You really need to rethink your policies @Uber_Support. "
2018-06-26 22:51:07+00:00,@Uber_Support hasn’t mended it’s ways. My wife questioned why we going to Muswe Hill from Heathrow via the M11. Driver tried to kick us out on the M25 at 23:50. #revoke #uber
2018-06-26 15:17:07+00:00,"My @Uber driver took my wallet and spent almost $100 on my credit card before returning it to me (I had to cancel the card before he admitted he had it) and @Uber_Support responded by charging me a $15 Lost Item Fee. I am never using Uber again, no matter how much a @lyft costs "
2018-06-26 15:04:29+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support! Thanks for increasing my surge pricing mid ride, discrediting my complaint and taking advantage of your customers. $7.75 per km seems totally reasonable, right? "

2018-06-25 18:00:41+00:00,The driver must have the details or phone no of that dirty lady.. try to persuade the driver to share the same with Mumbai Police. Uber is duty bound to provide the details of criminal offensive customer..

2018-06-25 17:32:29+00:00,"This is very very scary! That’s why I trust my neighbourhood taxi more than @Uber. A women was physically assaulted, called a chinky yet @Uber_Support does nothing. Aggregators are worthless in situations like this "

2018-06-25 16:47:49+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support the least you should do is to help @MumbaiPolice track down the woman.
2018-06-25 16:36:53+00:00,This is serious @Uber_Support Should we trust you anymore? @journojuno @MumbaiPolice
2018-06-25 13:48:57+00:00,What's with you @Uber_Support @UberINSupport @Uber_India ?? Why aren't you providing identity details of this woman to @MumbaiPolice ????
2018-06-25 11:36:09+00:00,Uber is just not customer friendly..but certainly criminal friendly @Uber
2018-06-25 11:07:30+00:00,@UberINSupport Please let us rate the co rider too when we rate our rides and bar people from taking Pool accordingly. Some of them are grade A assholes who fail to understand the concept of a pool ride.

2018-06-25 09:38:44+00:00,"That's the worst part. they wouldn't provide the details to even the police, we are just mere civilians. Mumbai Police so far has been very helpful though"
2018-06-25 09:36:17+00:00,Hey @Uber_India @Uber_Support what's stopping you to share the co-passenger details with @MumbaiPolice? CC: @amitjain1
2018-06-25 09:22:20+00:00,"My comment may seem crazy, but imagine the reverse happening. Crazy woman turning out to be even more dangerous, going to cops with fake story to get @journojuno's information with one phone call and landing up because she wasn't done assaulting. Privacy matters."
2018-06-25 09:18:11+00:00,"Scary story. But I, for one am relieved with the @Uber_Support response. Cops shouldn't be able to just make a phone call and ask for data. They SHOULD require a warrant or order or something before it is shared. Of course, crazy woman should not be spared, but privacy. Process. "
2018-06-25 09:17:06+00:00,Bloody hell @uber @Uber_Support instead of protecting a psycho you should be blacklisting her and cooperating with the police.
2018-06-25 09:12:45+00:00,And @imVkohli look how the Company you endorse is apathetic and nonchalant towards the safety of its consumer.....
2018-06-25 09:11:46+00:00,Horrendous. Please take care! I'm sure you have already given it a thought but cctv footage of people entering Urmi will definately be available.
2018-06-25 09:06:45+00:00,"Take care. For reference, in one case, a govt PSU refused sharing details of a tender citing confidentiality in the RFP. SC said your business clauses don’t supersede the law of the land. They had to submit all details. Businesses don’t exist in isolated islands"
2018-06-25 09:06:00+00:00,If they don;t share the information with @MumbaiPolice. Then better to shut @Uber operations in India.
2018-06-25 09:00:36+00:00,Do not forget to call her out here once you find her name. Hadd gundagardi h bhai!
2018-06-25 08:58:03+00:00,"You guys must help Mumbai Police in providing her identity since I have already filed an FIR against her. She should be banned form Uber because if it happened to me today, it can happen to anyone."

2018-06-25 08:35:42+00:00,this looks horrible. :( you should report this to @MumbaiPolice since the passenger was abusive.

2018-06-22 01:36:34+00:00,Dear @Uber_India @Uber_Support have used all forms of customer connect to tell you I'm getting charged multiple times for trips. No response. I can debug/fix the issue for you if your developers cant. Fixing your customer care is a more profound problem.
2018-06-22 01:04:03+00:00,It is Uber’s duty to find this information on your riders? As many adolescents have accounts and uber accepted this.
2018-06-21 22:11:06+00:00,Hahaha this is becoming comical. @Uber_Support @Uber will only respond when i tweet at them. And then after they message me back they don’t answer for 24 hours. Been going on for 3 days now. You guys are a JOKE. I have receipts and screenshots showing that you messed up
2018-06-21 20:25:34+00:00,I will start using local cab services and start supporting them instead of this unprofessional bundle of an app.
2018-06-21 19:52:45+00:00,1 hour 14 minutes for a ride that should take between 42-45 minutes...Justify this @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_India @Uber_Support and also ₹68 for wait...When the cabbie decides to refuel. Give back my money!!!! The distance from my office to home is 32 km not 40km. Explain! 
2018-06-21 18:18:27+00:00,Hi Leah is there an ombudsman I can use to settle a problem with @Uber that is not getting fixed by their hopeless “customer service”? @UberUK @Uber_Support @UberUKsupport @leahmilner My credit card is currently blocked despite them acknowledging a $156 charge in Miami was a scam
2018-06-21 17:14:40+00:00,I was explaining to my Uber driver what @vidcon is. I said it’s a convention about Youtube. He said “I don’t even know what Youtube is they keep coming up with all this new stuff.” Bizarre how he can driver Uber but not know what YouTube is. He in his 60s though. @Uber_Support
2018-06-21 14:31:01+00:00,Day 34 of waiting for #Uber to undo its #fraud @Uber_Support. One tweet and FB post a day till I find someone who cares. #uberfail @dkhos @UfterYou @consumercourtin #sickofthis
2018-06-21 14:12:36+00:00,you would think @Uber_Support wouldn’t withhold information about the last known location of a missing person but you’d be wrong af. they should be embarrassed this is disgusting.
2018-06-21 12:04:11+00:00,"Hey @Uber just want to know what happens to the driver when he cancels the trip? The rider is charged a fee, is a similar protocol followed for them too? @Uber_Support"
2018-06-21 11:17:33+00:00,#SupportIndieFilm I use @UberEats @Uber to support my passion for Filmmaking &amp; make money with my car &amp; you can too. Use this link to sign up: https://www.uber.com/signup/drive/deliver/?invite_code=c1uqacv7y #Uber @Uber_Support @UberFacts #UberEats
2018-06-21 09:45:20+00:00,Please just delete the app. Many of their drivers are unchecked. It is unsafe for women to be in cars alone with some of their drivers. check #uberrape. Use a London black cab and be safe... or a local minicab office. @TaxiappLdn
2018-06-21 07:44:33+00:00,It's high time you introduce Uber pooling in Pakistan. Please! @Uber_Support
2018-06-21 04:19:34+00:00,Thanks @Uber_Support ! You lost a customer who uses Uber everyday. @lyft vroom vroom here i come :)
2018-06-20 22:39:41+00:00,I can't believe @Uber does not have a direct line to call if you need help. I was concerned for my safety with one of their drivers and I had to wait an hour and a half to get a canned instant message from @Uber_Support #notacceptable
2018-06-20 21:52:51+00:00,"Hi @TfL, why is it ok for Uber to say “we’ve accepted your booking, now finding you a driver”, for it then to timeout, and when you rebook seconds later, it’s 33% more? @Uber @Uber_Support it’s really not on. It’s really poor, and it needs to be dealt with. "
2018-06-20 21:43:23+00:00,Your DM code is 3383
2018-06-20 19:27:55+00:00,Hey @dkhos @barneyh @Uber_Support Maybe you guys should read this. You took a driver who worked full time and deactivated him for #bullshit #Passengers Lie maybe you should do some real investigating as opposed to the cartoon ones you do! http://ridesharedashboard.com/2017/05/10/false-passenger-complaints-suspend-deactivate-drivers/
2018-06-20 16:15:17+00:00,"Hey hey @uber @Uber_Support , what’s the word on my missing stuff ? I have a plane to catch and my tools for work are in that bag ..."
2018-06-20 14:04:48+00:00,But what will you be paying for every journey if uber got the monopoly? X5 surge will be every journey. Support your local cab firms whilst they're there.
2018-06-20 13:38:10+00:00,Now factor in that your journey was subsidised by 59%. No do cheap really.
2018-06-20 13:31:51+00:00,£10 journey is subsidised real price £23ish unsustainable it must end soon the investors want a return get real delete the rape app 
2018-06-20 12:02:55+00:00,You get what you deserve I am a black cab driver and I was at Twickenham I took a couple to Dulwich village for £56 on the meter no surge pricing with us!
2018-06-20 11:58:36+00:00,"Or when you do use them, don’t go on about the price, by using them in the past you’ve helped destroy black cabs"
2018-06-20 09:19:15+00:00,"@Uber_Support so happy for the 180 days of change...give yourselves a raise, don’t let us see our trips, and now our direct deposits aren’t going through?"
2018-06-20 07:48:09+00:00,"Isn’t this what you’ve created, just think what’s gonna happen when they’ve wiped out your local mini cab companies. Check out #Wheretobritain"
2018-06-20 07:35:31+00:00,Chaos! Our £10 journey was £55!
2018-06-20 07:18:07+00:00,"Other minicab firms with apps?!? London Taxis with apps also went there, I did. Too many people think Uber are the only minicab firm with an app. Incredible ‘no uber end of the world’ syndrome."
2018-06-20 06:33:50+00:00,"There are plenty of choices in London, Uber are not the only PHV company and there’s always a black cab , who by the way don’t increase prices when demand is high. Try @TaxiappLdn"
2018-06-20 06:03:55+00:00,Wow that's awful. If only you had known about all the apps for black cabs eg @taxiapp_london
2018-06-20 03:55:22+00:00,So your driver conveniently started the trip and ended it too while I was still waiting for my cab and now I'm charged for a trip that I never took. What the hell is wrong with you @Uber_Support @Uber_Mumbai
2018-06-20 01:08:41+00:00,"By using them you have destroyed all the local Minicab firms, leaving you with no option. Welcome to the future the one you created"
2018-06-20 00:00:56+00:00,So people being stranded and unable to get home due to circumstances our of the consumers control. When you advertise a standard fair at £18 pound. Which point of that is fair...create a demand for your service then abuse consumer requirement when you can
2018-06-19 23:41:28+00:00,"@Uber_Support thanks for increasing the rates around twickenham, London tonight after tragic event on the train system 3.9 surge cost. A total of £73.17 for a 6 mile@journey ...#classy"
2018-06-19 23:11:30+00:00,"Yes of course but it also takes the mick when you wait 10 mins and then the driver cancels, and then another driver cancels and then another..."
2018-06-19 23:00:48+00:00,I think @Uber @Uber_Support should credit your account every time a driver cancels. It’s honestly ridiculous. They charge you if they cancel yet you can wait for 15 minutes for a driver and then they cancel on you. Poor service! 
2018-06-19 22:30:00+00:00,"@Uber_Support is unwilling or unable to address someone who started an account using my, not his own, email address. Perhaps you can have one of the smart Uber employees email me next time? Or maybe I will log into that account, change the password, and give a driver a $1m tip."
2018-06-19 21:57:44+00:00,"My @Uber driver couldn’t find the front of a building next to him, parked up for 10 minutes and kept calling me, then cancelled and gave me a $6 charge. Nice! @Uber_Support"
2018-06-19 21:12:36+00:00,Disgraceful. Had an issue with @panerabread two weeks ago and still haven’t received an answer. Bone in the chicken. Almost choked to death. Thankfully I live still.
2018-06-19 20:12:44+00:00,How can one expect the drivers to be trained well if Uber employees themselves have no concern about customers?! @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India @Uber_BLR
2018-06-19 19:44:19+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support we have a big issue here. Ableism is shit. #ableism #uber #servicedog #discrimination #badservice pic.twitter.com/be98TNgqJu

2018-06-19 14:45:57+00:00,@Uber_Support This is my second tweet about complaint. I was told rate the restaurant... that did not address the fact that I spent my hard earned money to receive a quality meal and that did not occur. I need this to be reconciled. The menu said fresh avocado! 
2018-06-19 10:41:13+00:00,Well my @Uber driver has nearly crashed into other cars no less than 3 times on this 20 min drive back to my house and is driving extremely recklessly @Uber_Support
2018-06-19 07:23:33+00:00,"@Uber charged me for a trip i never took and its ""Help""needs help. It has also been charging me the toll tax for trips within Delhi @Uber_Support @nitin_gadkari @RajatAroraET"

2018-06-18 22:43:10+00:00,Uber has been stealing money from my sons account without any rides and we have been trying to contact you over and over and they continue to do so. Multiple attempts to contact.
2018-06-18 21:23:07+00:00,Why force @Paytm @Uber @Uber_Support @UberINSupport when you take payment out of credit/debit cards just fine ??
2018-06-18 20:52:05+00:00,I’m fed up with your broken system @Uber_Support - charging me for a ride when the driver never showed up
2018-06-18 17:48:10+00:00,"Granted, but the thing is that you hope to use the service to get from Point A-B, not to report drivers. The time you waste is worth more than the money."
2018-06-18 17:34:25+00:00,"Hello @Uber_Support One of my students lost her phone in an Uber car that she didn’t book; we’ve tried everything to try to find it. Do you have a place where drivers give in lost items? We’re in Boca Raton, Florida. Please help!!!"

2018-06-18 01:34:05+00:00,"I think it's more ironic that Uber, a company that operates exclusively on phones, doesn't offer phone support. This is peak irony"
2018-06-17 19:59:56+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support why am I being charged more than it says in the app???
2018-06-17 18:01:51+00:00,If everyone stopped using Uber then this just wouldn’t happen! They would no longer exist! Just don’t call them in the first place.
2018-06-17 17:21:02+00:00,"Sorry guys, I’m not sure you understand. Maybe your page is run by a robot. I want to talk with @dkhos about making the process better as he says he cares, the support generic responses do not achieve anything."
2018-06-17 17:03:02+00:00,No your not.. I tried using the in app contact but all a driver ever gets is a generic response that’s a copy and paste. @dkhos can shoot me a PM so I can discuss with him directly.
2018-06-17 16:00:04+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber @dkhos why am I blocked from deleting my account?
2018-06-17 15:02:13+00:00,Whats happening @Uber_Mumbai @Uber_India @Uber_Support took 2 rides using Uber Mumbai Pass and both rides was charged more then what was shown bothe time 169 mumbai pass was not applied. 
2018-06-17 12:23:51+00:00,Can’t believe that this Uber thing has gotten as big as it has. Only hear bad things about them. Would never use them out of principle. #uber
2018-06-17 10:58:03+00:00,It's also unlicensed to operate at Gatwick. It's a London PHV and should be Crawley licensed. That may well mean when he has an accident he isn't insured. But don't worry about the law cos it's cheap.
2018-06-17 10:21:24+00:00,"1 day son, everyone’s king for a day"

2018-06-17 01:43:14+00:00,@uber will not take this seriously unless you report him to the police and your regulators.
2018-06-16 18:58:44+00:00,"Don't you think this is a matter for the police and not for his enablers at @uber to ""look into""?"
2018-06-15 12:03:58+00:00,Hi @UberUK @Uber_Support please can you DM your UK PR/media contact - phone and email. For a piece I’m doing on my Uber experiences this week in Miami. Thanks
2018-06-15 07:09:26+00:00,So how do you show you care if you can’t help because you guys don’t want to make a phone call? Can I send you guys a unlimited SIM card? Help the dude out man.

2018-06-13 14:22:15+00:00,To bring you up to date. The @Uber problem remains unresolved. The @Uber_Support group says the in-app team will respond. The in-app team has been silent for days. Worst customer service experience.
2018-06-13 12:40:56+00:00,What does @Uber @Uber_Support has to say about the attitude of this driver towards authority @Carabdechile in Chile? What if it had happened in the US @FoxNews ?

2018-06-13 01:07:39+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber should invest in their customer support centers and invest in real people answering their customer’ concerns @questions. My account was hacked weeks ago and they have yet to resolve it. 8 of their drivers were not paid because of their lack of urgency.

2018-06-10 18:43:06+00:00,"For those tuning in late, @Uber and @Uber_Support added a $20 surcharge for travel on CA-134 claiming it is a toll road. It is not. "
2018-06-10 18:32:13+00:00,One hour. No response from @Uber or @Uber_Support
2018-06-10 17:34:26+00:00,"And now, unable to back up their mendacious claim that CA-134 is a toll road charging $20, @Uber and @Uber_Support have fallen silent. Let’s start a clock. It’s 10:30 PDT."
2018-06-10 17:05:49+00:00,"When I again pointed out to @uber and @Uber_Support that there were no tolls on my route, I got this helpful response. Enjoy: "
2018-06-10 16:59:18+00:00,To recap: @uber added $20 onto my fare claiming that CA-134 was a toll road. I pointed out to them repeatedly that it is not a toll road. Here is the final answer from @Uber_Support 
2018-06-10 16:45:22+00:00,"All right, this is just getting hysterical. @Uber and @Uber_Support continue to maintain there were tolls on a route that has no tolls. "
2018-06-10 16:36:32+00:00,Anyone else want to explain to @Uber and @Uber_Support that CA-134 is not a toll road and their driver is attempting to steal $20? 
2018-06-10 16:24:03+00:00,"Amazing @Uber scam currently happening to me. An additional $20 charge added to a ride I took claiming to be a toll for a road that isn’t a toll road. Check your Uber receipts, everyone! @Uber_Support"
2018-06-10 02:43:02+00:00,"I don't think they do, but I keep hoping that if they get enough of them, maybe at some point they will. ""Just a fool's hope,"" probably, as Gandalf would say."
2018-06-10 02:32:50+00:00,What is the URL that @Uber @Uber_Support insists we use to report how terrible their scofflaw drivers are? I suppose I ought to just bookmark it.
2018-06-10 01:15:11+00:00,I ordered an UberX and it arrives with a passenger in the front seat - the driver’s young son. Is it being your child to work day @Uber_Support?
2018-06-09 21:37:57+00:00,Lmao it's a business first. A service second. Never forget.
2018-06-09 21:12:21+00:00,This is how customers are treated: Complete disgust and shame on @Uber_Support @Uber for blatantly ‘rolling back’ on account credits in a irrelevant move to defraud users. @dkhos : your customer ‘service’ lies and in turn champions pure theft!
2018-06-09 21:04:24+00:00,"I wait my delivery @Uber_Support the delivery-man was at 10 min from my adress and the apps say my order is arrived, its not !!! order : #C1452"

2018-06-09 18:23:33+00:00,"that;s a common thing, @Uber_Support is useless to both passengers and drivers they steal from both and have no problem getting away with it. Cannot believe no one wants to do a story on the BS that they pull!"
2018-06-09 16:35:54+00:00,"In an @Uber last night and he said he was in zone 5, I told him I had no idea where this was, when I finally found him it was an area with 5 mph limit, glad these drivers know their road signs lol (@Uber_Support)"
2018-06-09 16:19:00+00:00,I would really appreciate it if everyone would delete their @Uber app and download @lyft in support of my temper tantrum on @Uber_Support
2018-06-09 14:58:21+00:00,"Whoa. I will never use debit to pay for @Uber again. My friend @LizPW is victim of Uber driver making fraudulent cleaning charge to her debit account. @Uber_Support, pls investigate the driver and reverse this charge ASAP. "

2018-06-09 06:15:19+00:00,Hello @Uber_Support @Uber_India you were never there for support !! Get a life I'll not pay the due amount for the last ride taken until you provide refund to earlier ride 
2018-06-09 04:58:08+00:00,"hey Uber I hope you’re going to seriously look into this extremely distressing example of fatshaming and misogyny, it was upsetting and offensive and really makes me wary of trusting your drivers and nervous about using your service."
2018-06-09 04:41:27+00:00,"I was in this car and if @Uber @Uber_Support DOESNT issue a refund, apology +++ immediately they’re a fucked organization. The fact that they think they can treat people in such a GROSS WAY... https://twitter.com/lifewithdeborah/status/1005298078973353985"

2018-06-08 17:49:26+00:00,My @Uber driver refused to pick me up after seeing I needed help putting my bag into car &amp; made me cancel ride. I request another &amp; now have 15 min wait (others requesting uber here have 4-5 min wait - was I penalized?). Is @lyft better? Too many issues with #Uber @Uber_Support
2018-06-08 13:21:43+00:00,I ain't no snitch
2018-06-08 13:01:21+00:00,So @UberINSupport gives promocode for discount and cheats by showing different fares in customers device and drivers device. The fare in my app was 119.26 tht was including the 50 inr discount. And the fare I was asked by driver was 145.40 #uberfails #UberCheats @Uber_Support 
2018-06-08 00:16:56+00:00,please respond @Uber_Support someone i follow on snapchat that works for you posted this on their story and i’m scared for my safety

2018-06-07 23:54:22+00:00,Now I’m a little bit pissed. This @Uber pool is taking me miles past my house to deliver this package. It’s not even on the way! Wtf @Uber_Support.
2018-06-07 22:55:43+00:00,"This thread is infuriating! Russ, I’m I’ve locate my passport and am getting on a plane. I’ll be there with food ASAP. Having a disability and limited in mobility should not leave you in hunger in such a well developed country!!"
2018-06-07 18:58:05+00:00,Let me get this straight. You lose your phone in an @Uber_Support and then Uber sends you a verification code to your PHONE so you can contact them?
2018-06-07 18:05:25+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber could you maybe teach your drivers that the bike lane isn’t a parking lot?
2018-06-07 12:59:40+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_India @Uber_Support @dkhos #shameonuber #ubercheats Uber seems to be selective to its customers. I would recommend people to stop using Uber. They don't care for you. I had complained yesterday evening about the overcharge, no reply. #disappointinguber"
2018-06-07 09:45:36+00:00,Yet again @Uber_Support disappoints! How about hiring actual people to solve consumer problems and not robots? Thanks!
2018-06-07 06:56:00+00:00,"Now asked @Uber_Support more than 20 times to help me. Each time a generic response. Each time a request for confirmation they are proactively going to help me. Answer always pure deflection. Shambolic, lazy, silo-dominated organisation."
2018-06-07 03:57:58+00:00,"Congratulations @Uber @Uber_India @Uber_Delhi @Uber_Support. It's the start of the morning, and two cabbies have managed to corner me to cancel at the thought of crossing the border in the NCR. Thought, mind you. Slow claps."
2018-06-07 02:30:51+00:00,"@Uber_Support you people have no phone number, i dont know how to solve this problem. I have no uber and i keep getting texted by uber people. where are these texts coming from? are you hacked?"
2018-06-07 02:25:54+00:00,A week later there is no help or a decent reply from @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India apart from asking for my number and giving me a link to write my entire issue on. I STILL CAN’T BOOK A CAB!
2018-06-07 01:34:02+00:00,Horrible. I have wasted 30 mins of my life tonight. In a car home now and it is definitely not an Uber.
2018-06-07 01:24:26+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support - I've had three drivers in a row cancel on me while they were one block away. Do you have a mutiny on your hands tonight in Manhattan?
2018-06-06 23:02:49+00:00,Had the pleasure of sitting behind one of the “dual” @Uber @lyft drivers as he rolled down the window and dumped garbage onto the road. To whom may I report this trash? #milwaukee #DriveTime #responsable @Uber_Support @AskLyft
2018-06-06 22:18:02+00:00,You do ZERO to protect drivers against kids filing a false complaint in retaliation against drivers who refuse to give them rides. Your policy is set up to pressure drivers into breaking the law or face the possibility of termination. (1/2)
2018-06-06 20:00:02+00:00,Hi @dkhos does @Uber or @Uber_Support even read the driver feedback? 
2018-06-06 19:52:39+00:00,"Dara, You claim change for Uber that will be beneficial for Drivers. How about you change @jamesriverins!!

2018-06-06 19:24:05+00:00,@UberEats ordered an Uber Eats... app says it’s delivered 30 minutes ago. Yet my stomach is still empty... help please @Uber_Support!

2018-06-06 04:22:52+00:00,"Ah! @Uber_Support! I challenge you to a duel!! You ride south on Valencia from 14th street. I ride north from 26th. Whoever can break (with a hatchet, of course) the most side mirrors off ubers parked in the bike lane wins! **throws fingerless gloves to the ground** "
2018-06-06 04:17:06+00:00,You guys charged me for 2 trips this morning which I never took. If u guys need money then beg don't steal by charging for trips that I never took. I want my refund @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India @uber #uber_india @UberINSupport
2018-06-06 04:16:37+00:00,"Hey @Uber_India, Does it take 22+ days to resolve an issue raised by a customer? Also, @Uber_Support is so pathetic that i need to ask you guys for an update everytime!"
2018-06-06 03:15:28+00:00,Hi @dkhos does your @Uber or @uber_support even read the customer feedback? Have been consistently providing feedback on the poor route selection and actually see a further deterioration in the route selection!!
2018-06-06 01:37:12+00:00,"@Uber_Support uber driver dropped me off at 7:30. Receipt says 7:48. Also end of trip was not where he dropped me off. I was overcharged, $17. Dollar difference from an exact same trip previously."
2018-06-06 01:37:03+00:00,So who has seen the NEW moving forward uber commercial? Just more ENTITLEMENT and REWARDS for Riders while NO NEW BENEFITS for DRIVERS .... a total LOAD OF CRAP @dkhos @uber @Uber_Support
2018-06-05 23:42:45+00:00,Four different uber drivers have picked me as a rider and then just were like lmao nah I change my mind @Uber_Support IM TRYING. TO GET TO WORK.
2018-06-05 21:05:44+00:00,I do the exact same thing
2018-06-05 21:01:13+00:00,"Ur issue is w uber, not me. Stop trying to be a twitter thug. Also, your attitude sucks."
2018-06-05 19:25:37+00:00,"My initial contact with you was Saturday. The first thing I hear back from you is Tues in a public forum asking me to DM you my information? I have repeatedly requested a response through the app and email but you’ve never bothered. You have all of my information, use it."
2018-06-05 15:57:00+00:00,Just need to get everyone on board...
2018-06-05 15:41:39+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, I got charged almost 150% of the advertised price because my driver: 1. Said she arrived, but then drove away and actually picked me up 20 mins later 2. After finally dropping me off, drove over a mile away before ending the trip. So what gives @Uber?"
2018-06-05 14:22:07+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Uber has the WORST customer service ever. Their twitter handle Uber “support” is a complete joke. They couldn’t care less about their customers. Why not provide a customer service phone number? Because they don’t offer customer service period. 
2018-06-05 13:48:14+00:00,"Someone just got into my uber, used my card, took a free ride & impossible to contact real person @Uber_Support for help #scam #poorcustomerservice"
2018-06-05 10:30:43+00:00,So @Uber_Support didn't get back to me on Twitter but I did get a 27-word statement in an email from their press line. Read more about an Orlando woman who left her mother's ashes in an @Uber and all the ways she hasn't gotten them back. https://fcnews.tv/2LkRaZQ

We think we had a non-licensed Uber driver pick us up (driving someone else’s account - scary) he stole my iPhoneX &amp; Uber is not helping us resolve the situation (started on SATURDAY). Please RT so @Uber knows we care about support!
2018-06-04 19:33:15+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support I've been waiting on a reply on your email since the last 1 week. Your app is asking me to pay for my last trip, something that i've already done and isn't allowing me to book another cab and your customer service is as approachable as the CIA"
2018-06-04 15:53:10+00:00,AVOID @UberEats @Uber_Support and use @Deliveroo they got my order out in under 30 mins unlike #UberEATS who 1hr 30 later I was stil waiting and no support just saying to wait.
2018-06-04 15:37:35+00:00,1hr and 20mins and still no #UberEATS @Uber_Support @UberEats and there help desk offered no financial compensation and I’ve had to go elsewhere. Shocking excuse of a company #avoid

2018-06-04 11:53:13+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support I've seen you recent ad campaign about 'listening' from your new CEO. A woman I am writing a story on in Orlando left her mother's ashes in an Uber last week and is frustrated with the lack of support she has received. Can anything be done?
2018-06-04 08:09:32+00:00,this is an interesting idea! Will share it with the team 
2018-06-04 05:46:57+00:00,@Olacabs @ola_supports @Uber_India @Uber_Support @UfterYou @LogicalIndians If you want to waste time in travel then opt for #Uberpool and if want to waste more time then best is to opt for #Olashare. Both competing well in wasting travellers’ time through haphazard pickup system.
2018-06-04 03:47:34+00:00,That’s exactly my point. Complained three times. And received 3 automated emails doing nothing about it.
2018-06-04 02:53:36+00:00,in no shape or form was the customer service helpful. oh and then it started raining. @Uber_Support 
2018-06-04 02:33:41+00:00,"@Uber_Support your driver never contacted me and he took an opposite route to come to my pick up location (I was watching his car through the app!) and I was charged $5 for my ride that never came cause he cancelled on me, thanks a ton guys."
2018-06-04 01:49:58+00:00,Hahahahaha WOW
2018-06-03 21:13:55+00:00,Today my @Uber decided not to take me to my destination and bring me “somewhere better”. Like what? @Uber_Support
2018-06-03 20:23:19+00:00,Bro. I have sent you multiple messages on the ‘in-app support’ but you haven’t replied to me in nearly 3 days.
2018-06-03 16:39:49+00:00,Thank you @Uber_Support happy with the support 
2018-06-03 15:45:33+00:00,But @Uber @Uber_Support ...I was standing right there when your driver Mark rollled right past me and cancelled my ride and then charged me. You know I want a refund right? I’m like LeBron right now at this airport. 
2018-06-03 14:24:08+00:00,When @Uber charges you $130 for an Uber that didn’t even come.... @Uber_Support

2018-06-03 08:45:38+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support thankyou so much. Its been 1 week and my issue is not resolved. Fantastic! I think your so called specialist team is having a summer vacation. Can I join them?

2018-06-02 06:10:11+00:00,I asked @Uber_Support that why they had given only PayTM as the wallet option as I don’t want to operate PayTM anymore as there are concerns of them sharing personal information with government(as per COBRA sting). No answer yet.
2018-06-02 01:14:21+00:00,"Curious...did you ask for or demand an aux cord? BTW, do you ever consider the driver does not want to listen to your music?

2018-05-29 20:02:49+00:00,A lesson for proper taxis. Get with the times and allow on line payment. Don’t let our OAPs down.

2018-05-10 20:19:35+00:00,Extremely disappointed with @Uber @Uber_Support . Took an Uber originally showing the fare as $57.00. Cab took 1h longer than indicated and I was charged $142.00. Support will not adjust. Have taken this route many times for $60. Any good competitors as I will not use Uber again?

2018-05-10 18:55:17+00:00,I’m just now seeing what you considered “follow up” and it is anything but substantive.

2018-05-10 06:21:21+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber_India is this fare for real?! We ordered a car not a helicopter.

2018-05-09 04:34:22+00:00,Is this how you are resolving it? If your driver feels “unsafe” they can refuse to transport children in car seats?

2018-05-02 04:09:18+00:00,.@Uber_Support Lost my phone and can't get into my account. Need help NOW.
2018-05-02 04:07:31+00:00,This guys is famous DAMMIT
2018-05-02 02:20:42+00:00,What the fuck. 3 minutes away for 6 minutes and counting. #DoesThisThingWork ? @Uber @Uber_Support pic.twitter.com/z810j2VL7R
2018-05-02 01:28:03+00:00,".@Uber @Uber_Support I need help that the app is not giving me. Was charged over three times my initial price for app/driver errors, and only reimbursed for half. Outrageous. Please contact me for details."

2018-05-01 21:14:09+00:00,"but when i order a burger and fries but get delivered just the burger without the fries, i contact support, am told that they can't credit my account, then threatened to have my account suspended when i call out the bullshit.

2018-05-01 05:40:53+00:00,"What a superb service @Uber_India. Driver refused to take pickup saying it's too far(ETA 15min). @Uber_Support thanks for leaving me trapped at midnight. Further more had to pay cancellation charges, yeah I deserved it, coz believed blindly @Uber. #Apni_hi_gaadi"
2018-04-30 20:56:41+00:00,Agree. @Uber_Support has reached out so we'll see if anything comes of it.
2018-04-30 18:41:59+00:00,Nothing quite like the passive aggression and rudeness found in messages from @Uber customer service. (@Uber_Support)
2018-04-30 17:30:18+00:00,My cousin just got into an argument with her uber driver & he sent her this disturbing video once he dropped her off. RT to spread awareness guys @Uber @Uber_Support 
2018-04-30 17:14:54+00:00,Experienced the same and I m sure @Uber will not do anything on this.
2018-04-30 17:07:24+00:00,". @Uber_Support @Uber A New Low ! Driver called and asked to cancel as he was 9 min away, When i refused to cancel, all i rcvd was Abuse, Threats, Foul Language and Insult. I can guarantee that he was totally Drunk and was on spkr wid one more person"
2018-04-30 12:00:19+00:00,FYI - here's how much @Uber cares about your credit card security: if there's an improper charge (like 16!) they ask you to EMAIL TEN DIGITS AND EXPIRATION DATE of the card charged. Unbelievable. @Uber_Support 
2018-04-30 11:16:38+00:00,Wow - @Uber_Support sends a driver down the wrong one way street. Pickup goes from 2 mins to 10+. And then cancellation results in $5 fee. Bad maps charging the customer= pretty annoying.
2018-04-30 09:16:28+00:00,"You are unbelievable, If I were the uber driver I would have not let you in either, you have clearly been drinking and you may have dropped food in my car and you abused him verbally before he called you a name, thanks for sharing how selfish you really are."
2018-04-30 08:21:44+00:00,@Uber_Support Worst experience ever I booked a cab and the cab Driver arrived with two other people in his cab I was with my family. I asked him to cancel but he just started the ride and was abusive. After that he just went away rashly. Pathetic Service #Uber
2018-04-30 06:45:00+00:00,"""WE SEE YOUR OUTREACH."".........FFS."
2018-04-30 06:34:55+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support? How about, when I'm in the airport queue, only offering me rides *from the airport*? I particularly don't want rides from the skeevy strip club down the street."
2018-04-30 05:17:15+00:00,can someone explain why my uber driver didn't have her seatbelt on??? @Uber_Support 
2018-04-30 03:01:18+00:00,"Yea, the next ride took over an hour to get to us; and then I sat on a To go cup of soup in the back of the car. Pretty much sums up my life "

2018-04-29 22:59:27+00:00,I never made that order. I am absolutely fuming this has happened & my trust has been broken I have spent the last 2 hours on calls via my bank & Uber and totally expect some compensation for the stress and broken trust and the amount to be fully refunded. Absolutely unacceptable
2018-04-29 22:57:25+00:00,"My Uber account was hacked I have an IP address and enough details to believe it was the delivery driver who delivered an order to the house tonight order made from my partners account.

2018-04-29 21:01:17+00:00,WTH @Uber_Support if you’re driver cancels on me after nearly 10 mins what do I get in compensation?
2018-04-29 19:26:23+00:00,Please Dayna refrain from bringing food in our cars in future. You ride for 5mins and stink out the cars for 5hrs. We don't want to be stinking of McDonald's or kebab. Plus have some consideration for the next rider after you. Plus if you spill your drink you want a £60 bill
2018-04-29 18:35:38+00:00,@shattawalegh I just heard the @Uber_Support @Ubergulf @uber #ubergirl track. @Uber really need to pay you big for that track because the promotion is priceless. Lets go #Gringo

2018-04-29 07:26:53+00:00,It’s ridiculous that I was charged $90 for an @Uber_Support when 1) it said 24$and 2) it said i took an hour and 57 min trip when I took a 15 min trip..............
2018-04-29 05:01:01+00:00,". @Uber 's got to be the worst service across industries. Customer Service is pathetic and people, rude. Don't even bother to revert. I guess they need to pull up their socks if they are to be relevant in the market!! @Uber_Support @amitjain1 @Uber_India @UberINSupport"

2018-04-27 19:26:09+00:00,This standard machine generated response is tiring @Uber_Support Stop it and do something!
2018-04-27 17:05:17+00:00,"So basically, @Uber_Support - if I leave something valuable in a car, follow the app instructions to contact driver FIVE TIMES, driver chooses not to pickup nor to respond, I have no recourse? I call that theft."

2018-04-27 04:27:50+00:00,Shoutout to @Uber @Uber_Support letting my account get hacked. Apparently I ordered 4 different Uber Eats in London last night making my own bank account go negative! That was so smart of me!

2018-04-26 01:26:13+00:00,Most likely someone who works for the credit card processor they use rather than your driver though. Hope they haven't had a big security breach or something. Every company I've worked at has had security holes in IT.
2018-04-26 01:16:20+00:00,"That is ridiculous. Not only was the Uber much later than its estimated arrival, we had to travel with additional passengers when we did not pay for an Uber pool. If this is not fixed everyone I know and I will switch to another ride share option. Ridiculous."
2018-04-26 00:53:03+00:00,"On the phone to @Uber_Support, and while waiting on hold for someone to pick up the phone, I get asked to check if I can fix the problem online. Given it takes a team of experts to find the number to call it, I've probably already tried that. Thanks anyway."

2018-03-05 05:15:04+00:00,"Tell me you’ve had a worse Uber driver, I dare you @Uber @Uber_Support @BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews @BuzzFeedEnt @Uber_NYC @lyft"

2018-03-04 21:59:56+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support thanks for sending me a discount code for my next trips. Shame its only useable for Singapore as I left that country 2 days ago...... Can I get it changed to be used in my current location instead?
2018-03-04 21:44:38+00:00,Why were one of your customers asked to play £50 for a 3 mile journey on Wednesday?? Exploiting ppl during bad weather that’s why!! the quicker you robbers get out of this country the better.
2018-03-04 18:26:29+00:00,Thats the drivers fault if the suggested route on GPS was not followed. What has this to do with the rider. Sort it out Uber.
2018-03-04 18:18:45+00:00,"Happens every time man. Even though I reached my destination in time with driver following GPS, this is the reply @Uber_Support people gave me. Inflating the fare from 181 to 484! Look at this @Uber"

2018-02-28 14:43:21+00:00,Part of the problem is refusing to pull out of traffic for drop off/pick ups. The cars just stop in their lane.

2018-02-27 15:54:42+00:00,@Uber_Support Why do drivers wait six or seven minutes for passengers who exceed the allotted two minutes? I had to cancel an Uber I was already in because the person sharing our Express Pool took so long. Probably missing my train anyway.
2018-02-27 14:51:17+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support - can you make a feature where I can make clear to my driver just to go the route the gps says and not their own ‘crafty’ route that rarely saves time??????

2018-02-21 19:05:49+00:00,"Thanks but we've done that twice, and we get the same reply saying she took the ride. Can you guarantee me she'll not get a generic answer this time?"

2018-02-21 13:06:11+00:00,So @Uber_Support @Uber deems fit to send me a response with a recommendation that I should rate this driver low. Now u know ladies...at your own risk

2018-01-29 02:25:44+00:00,Heya @Uber_Support! We are trying to organise an Uber with a baby car seat. Is that possible in Australia? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.
2018-01-28 20:19:38+00:00,@Uber_Support especially on the weekends. I have proof my accounts been hacked and these motherfuckers dragging their feet like cyber security isn’t an issue nowadays. @Uber if you cared for your “partners” this shit would never happen! pic.twitter.com/AUoV9XSEMH
2018-01-28 17:25:20+00:00,They’ve put the credit back on my account. Which is not really what I would want...
2018-01-28 16:37:31+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support you charged me $10 for a ride I didn’t take last night and I would like that back please and thank you.
2018-01-28 10:07:39+00:00,"Nope. Called the police. Clearly, y’all don’t care until riders have to."
2018-01-28 10:04:19+00:00,Ughhhh right??
2018-01-28 05:29:13+00:00,Thanks for trolling my toll conversation
2018-01-28 04:35:35+00:00,"Hello @Uber_Support. Yet again, driver denies that toll charge is part of the trip payment. Please educate your drivers. This one does not even have an RFID."
2018-01-28 01:00:23+00:00,"Tbh, I’m not going to worry about $30 cash. I’m blessed that no one stole my card and that I got my stuff back and that’s what’s important."
2018-01-27 18:51:20+00:00,Thank you @Uber_Support 
2018-01-27 18:34:53+00:00,Does @uber let passengers know when we rate them or only let them know when we had an issue with them? It would be nice if @uber let the passenger know that we appreciated them and remind them to tip us. @Uber_Support #tipuber
2018-01-27 18:01:25+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India appreciate the promptness of a lady calling once unsafe reporting was done but need to know if such extreme rude behaviour at a late hour is followed up with a suspension of license ? To ensure safety to all women travelling in Uber ?
2018-01-27 14:50:38+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support my driver picked up someone else and started the trip so i cancelled and want a refund.
2018-01-27 05:43:03+00:00,"In one day I've had two drivers ""pick me up"" &never reach me. I was charged full price for both rides. Never picked up. Twice.@Uber_Support"
2018-01-26 23:26:20+00:00,@Uber_Support @uber if my family is in one of these Uber’s I’ll be pissed
2018-01-26 18:56:19+00:00,What movie?
2018-01-26 18:46:29+00:00,My driver watched a movie on his iPad while driving me home from DTLA and they didn’t do shit.
2018-01-26 16:05:33+00:00,just a reminder to everyone that uses @Uber that yesterday I was charge TEN TIMES the cost of my ride with NO explanation and absolutely ZERO assistance from @Uber_Support do yourself a favor and take @lyft from now on.
2018-01-26 14:53:57+00:00,Big week @AskPlayStation as they deal with fixing the #playstationnetwork #psndown http://helphandl.es/1UjqdCw 1 @AskPlayStation 2 @AmazonHelp 3 @virginmedia 4 @AppleSupport 5 @BurgerKing 6 @Delta 7 @Tesco 8 @hulu_support 9 @AmericanAir 10 @Uber_Support
2018-01-26 12:17:43+00:00,You mean fill every street in every town and city with Uber drivers causing pollution and gridlock across the country just so you can get a car instantly. Call your local Cab office a couple of minutes before you need to go
2018-01-26 04:51:54+00:00,"If you pepper spray me, why wouldn't I drag you outta my car. SMH. All these pple trying to play victims while they r actually d aggressors. Seeking to trend nd remain popular by all means. "
2018-01-26 04:49:49+00:00,"This lady is a fake though. Someone who tried to rape u, held d door open for u to step out? Maybe it's time for @Uber @Uber_Support and @Taxify_ng ask their drivers to install dash cameras. TBH. Lady muted, ND edited dis video to d point she started shouting."
2018-01-26 01:35:43+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, when one of your drivers puts a client in danger, you should really deal with it before it hits social media that you’ve ignored @AIMEESONG for two days "
2018-01-25 23:54:12+00:00,"Uber has become pathetic ever since they dropped the incentives for drivers. Support is horrible, mechanical responses to all issues instead of solutions. People don't even understand the problem. Uber grew too fast and this is the problem."
2018-01-25 22:55:26+00:00,Me: boss im going to tema Uber: how much is the fare Me: Ghs12.00 boss Uber: please cancel n request another @Uber_Support Find this maniac 
2018-01-25 21:30:18+00:00,"@Uber_Support and @UberFR were very swift in responding to my earlier complaints, and I thank them for that. However I feel like the ultimate response I got wasn’t great. I think they should have at least reimbursed our fare."
2018-01-25 19:44:42+00:00,I didn’t get a plate as I was riding. This should be general knowledge anyone with a drivers license should have.
2018-01-25 17:34:27+00:00,Seems like @Uber_India service is going from bad to worse....surge seems to be all the times. The @Uber_Support doesn’t revert to any issues posted. Still waiting for them to respond!
2018-01-25 15:22:58+00:00,"So @Uber @Uber_Support @UberNigeria please explain this to me. Your drivers are out of hand and I fully blame you. And for God’s sake, my card was already my payment option. Called him to scould him and he ended the call. #Uber #CustomerRelations"
2018-01-25 14:55:08+00:00,Because I'm bored of them using the horn at 3am outside my house because the lights have been green for about a nanosecond
2018-01-25 14:31:28+00:00,"This @Uber_CHI drv claimed something was wrong with her car when I told her idling in the bike lake is illegal, then it magically fixed itself when her passenger arrived. @Uber @Uber_Support "
2018-01-25 11:19:28+00:00,"I'd suggest that with your ability to observe many cars in the traffic as you overtake, you note details of the Uber & other taxis with the satnav/ mobile phone placed illegally blocking the required views from the driver's position. A VERY common feature with Uber cars"
2018-01-25 09:07:05+00:00,".@Uber @Uber_Support seriously, can your drivers not honk their horns at cyclists who take the lane? We are entitled to be there and you are an illegal service who is not. Oh and STOP DOUBLE PARKING. get it?"
2018-01-25 03:02:19+00:00,"Yo @AskLyft @lyft this driver has had me waiting in fucking bodega for the last 40min, i literally cant afford to cancel, thats $9 i dont have, and he’s ignoring my text/calls. This is totally unacceptable. Tell Shazad to cancel this fuckin ride so i can call an @Uber_Support pic.twitter.com/10h8V8wIUn"
2018-01-25 01:35:46+00:00,"Nice work, @Uber_Support. Two rounds of “support” with no progress. Do your people even read the notes before they pick which canned response to trigger?"
2018-01-25 01:01:06+00:00,"My order just got delayed 20 minutes so the driver could drop off another order. This happened to me yesterday as well and ruined my dinner. It was soggy, cold fried food. Please stop this practice. Late / cold food is a #fail @Uber_Support"
2018-01-25 00:54:40+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support. Last night your driver purposefully took a longer route (without asking me) and made 4 wrong turns resulting in me missing a paid session with my trainer. I did not feel safe as he was blatantly ignoring the GPS and I didn't know where I was. Refund?
2018-01-24 19:50:50+00:00,when are you adding this to your fleet @Uber_Support @Uber
2018-01-24 19:34:54+00:00,He did that. And when I told him Brooklyn he said “I’ll be right there.” Why not tell me then if it’s a problem? #honesty
2018-01-24 13:39:25+00:00,If your @Uber_Support driver calls you a nigger just kno @Uber will do nothing about it....
2018-01-24 10:55:45+00:00,Not satisfied with a response are you serious? She was taken to an industrial site and doors locked? Is that all you offer as assistance to a member of public?Are you sure you are the regulator? You are there to protect the public are you not? @MetCC
2018-01-24 07:11:26+00:00,.@Uber_Support can you please update your maps for Doha considering new additions to Lusail expressway? It’s causing headaches for drivers &amp; customers. This was meant to be a simple journey... 
2018-01-24 06:04:37+00:00,"Hi @Uber_Support I left my glasses in an uber in Melbourne last month, contacted the driver who said he would drop them to my job, but hasn't and now won't answer my calls or texts. Is there anything I can do about this? Help a blind gal out ."
2018-01-24 05:04:42+00:00,Why Uber is not taking action against driver. Does Uber support this type of activities? @Uber_Support @amitjain1
2018-01-24 02:10:58+00:00,The tipping option should have defaulted tip amount when a ride ends. Passengers should actively have to deny a tip rather than select one. #Rideshare is a service industry we aren't a charity. @uber_support @uber @asklyft #tipuber #tiplyft
2018-01-23 22:46:15+00:00,@Uber_Support you might wanna keep an eye on your Minneapolis people...
2018-01-23 19:52:46+00:00,I wish people would stop tagging me in regards to their uber problems I have fucking nothing to do with the Uber company's tech support
2018-01-23 16:58:53+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support you really need to fix an issue that is a real problem. If I have one more driver call to ask where I’m going after waiting for them only to have them cancel bc they don’t feel like going that way- I’m gunna go crazy.We get fined if we cancel. Where’s their fee?
2018-01-23 16:52:28+00:00,"Yo, @Uber_Support, someone keeps trying to use my phone number to sign up for your service. I don't even have an account with you. Can you put my number on a block list, please?"
2018-01-23 16:27:10+00:00,Hope these fellows take action. Otherwise be ready for a proper action
2018-01-23 16:25:10+00:00,"Dear.. Please see the thread... The issue started from in app and has progressed to ""Mute Day 2"" from your side. Kindly put some efforts. And yes I've once again filed an ""in app complaint"" @UfterYou"
2018-01-23 15:30:15+00:00,*Mute Day 2* There has been no response by @Uber either on mail or by a call. High handedness of a company is quite evident. Customer left at their mercy awaiting redressal.
2018-01-23 15:28:20+00:00,"Nadia, I trust u r ok after your ordeal. It’s one of many issues both Taxi’s & legal licensed Operators have been trying to alert the public 2 without success as the gov endorse uber for their own gain. Please contact the police, it’s happening 2 too many girls &amp; has 2 stop."
2018-01-23 10:25:35+00:00,Contact the police not the regulator
2018-01-22 23:37:36+00:00,@Uber_DC @Uber @Uber_Support I need someone from your team to contact me ASAP regarding this driver 
2018-01-22 22:48:54+00:00,Why did u think 3 bags of food and two drinks was your order though?

2018-01-22 19:58:26+00:00,Goals
2018-01-22 19:50:12+00:00,The problem with @Uber and @Uber_Support is that they care more about their drivers than their riders (the people who are actually generating an income for their company). All they do is scam people of their money with unnecessary cleaning and delivery fees.
2018-01-22 13:57:53+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support Your driver refuse to come after accepting the drive because he didn’t like my destination. He forced me to cancel the request. You have deducted 44 rs for it. What to do? 
2018-01-22 13:22:17+00:00,I am not using @Uber anymore. I have been robbed by their driver and they decided not to do anything about it. Sadly that's how they treat a loyal customer after more than 2 years. Switching to @careem!! @Uber_Support
2018-01-22 12:34:31+00:00,"@Uber_Support @Uber_India @Uber So finally you guys decide to go Mute... Testing the customers patience. Hmm . I'm game.

2018-01-22 09:10:44+00:00,This @Olacabs is trying to sell their shared ride pass every time I open their app. But whenever I try to book a shared ride. Their drivers keep canceling it. Isn't this double cheating. @Olacabs got the money of pass but isn't providing the services.
2018-01-22 09:01:25+00:00,"This @ola_supports @Olacabs is more pathetic. Their drivers cancel the shared rides without even asking ""Drop kaha karna hai"". Registered complaint. But as expected @Olacabs neber replied to what action was taken. #cheat #pathetic #Ola"

2018-01-22 06:02:32+00:00,One of the many disadvantages of doing digital transactions in india.
2018-01-22 04:11:19+00:00,"@Uber_Support @Uber How do you justify this? Waited 26 mins for a ride that was ""Arriving soon"" on 9:11 am &amp; still charged Cancellation fee out of nothing! Can you call me?"
2018-01-22 01:10:42+00:00,"And @Uber_Support continues to hire #illiterate drivers .. who forget about reading a gps , cnt even read the name of buildings standing outside it ... seems almost like every dumbass who can breathe is being handed a car #uber #fail #destroying #reputation and business"
2018-01-21 17:31:30+00:00,Have received 1 response (out of 3) and unfortunately it seems that it was altogether my mistake in booking the cab. Uber seems to be not at all caring about customer grievances and only involved in extracting money. Not even sure whether the other two concerns will be taken up.
2018-01-21 15:45:23+00:00,"Still waiting for @Uber_Support it's only been 22hours, maybe I should give them sometime"
2018-01-21 13:11:45+00:00,"@Uber_Support How can u say that u CANNOT provide a corrected invoice since it's ""automated""? I paid 571/- &amp; you give invoice of 422/-. So officially that's what goes into your account books.So u pocket the diff incl underpayment of tax to @FinMinIndia @UfterYou #UberScam"
2018-01-21 10:28:00+00:00,Looking in to this meaning what you exactly? They’ll keep “investigating” while we keep getting kidnapped.
2018-01-21 08:21:03+00:00,Also been working on getting @PharmaXtracts to accept #xvg they already support coinbase purchases and hopefully they will integrate and add #verge and be the first cbd supplier for #xvg they are a great company with a great product
2018-01-21 05:49:29+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support my ride keeps saying it's 1 minute away then it goes to like 10 minutes away it's been constantly doing this for an hour I've called my Uber drive 20 minutes ago and he said he was a few minutes away (around the corner) very frustrating 
2018-01-20 19:29:58+00:00,This automated response is also hilarious
2018-01-20 19:13:57+00:00,"Hi, we're here to help. Please DM us the email linked to your Uber account so we can look into this for you."
2018-01-20 19:13:12+00:00,@Uber_Support I’m going to want that $2 back fam....

2018-01-20 12:47:45+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support why won't the app let me update an expired card? It says I can't add a card because I already have one, only offers the option to delete, then tells me I can't delete because it's the only payment option. Grrrr"
2018-01-20 11:53:25+00:00,last night my Parisian @Uber_Support driver was texting with two hands while driving with one knee (peep my Snapchat story for proof) and then he got into a fist fight with a taxi driver after he drove past our drop off location- don’t you think this deserves a refund? THEY DONT!
2018-01-20 09:37:15+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support This is the second time this week that a female friend of mine has felt unsafe while traveling in your taxis. How tough is it to do a basic background check? Are you that greedy to get drivers that you ignore basic safety?
2018-01-20 09:12:04+00:00,Fuck you @Uber @Uber_Support I just had to walk 2.7 miles home because you hired a serial killer to try to drive us home then total his car on the way after he tried to eat us for dinner. Delete your app from my phone I don’t have time to waste on yall.
2018-01-20 07:47:37+00:00,Well it’s now one full day and @uber @Uber_Support have no answers no updates. I always thought this is the best startup with Customer experience

2018-01-19 10:07:51+00:00,"I will, although it’s not about just giving them a bad rating. Uber should be screening out these creeps during their alleged background checks. I know that you can’t screen for ‘asshole’ but you can definitely interview - which Uber doesn’t do."

Her operation was done that day and driver has refused to drop us though i had put the exact location. And he asked us to get out of the car. Read below @aditiraval @Uber_Support

2018-01-16 04:38:35+00:00,!!!! ESPECIALLY with what we just experienced this evening! No thoughtfully written out note will do this complaint justice. I’m utterly appalled and feared for the safety of myself and my peers

We have a capsule that can be strapped in and meets Australian standards however need to know that we can use Uber with it. Frustrating lack of info about riding with kids on website. http://www.joiebaby.com.au/shop/car-seats/meet-gemm-infant-car-seat-midnight/
2018-01-14 21:50:20+00:00,I should have just called my daughter a taxi. Learn from my mistake - don't use @Uber no matter how much your kids tell you to. Get them a cab.
2018-01-14 21:49:17+00:00,WARNING: DO NOT under any circumstances buy an Uber gift card to get your loved one home safely. If the code is used before your recipient can add it (minutes after purchase) @Uber_Support will tell you tough shit. They will steal your money and ignore you.
2018-01-14 21:43:39+00:00,"We appreciate you bringing this to our attention, Niraj. We've brought this to the attention of our India team, who will be reaching out to you soon once they've had a chance to complete a review of the trip. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this."

2018-01-14 20:17:01+00:00,"rly cant believe @Uber_Support believes its fair to charge $20 for salt getting in the car ITS WINTER IN CHICAGO, just wipe it off???"
2018-01-14 18:40:29+00:00,So @Uber now keeps on rolls the most unprofessional drivers. This driver ended my ride 30mins after my actual drop off &amp; changed my drop location to some random spot on d H’way to mint triple the actual amount! Horrendous customer service. Time to #boycott #Uber @Uber_Support 
2018-01-14 16:57:19+00:00,"@TajinderBagga Bhai , always use @Uber . @Uber_Support team is far better than @Olacabs . Also their driver are much more professional."

2018-01-13 12:50:42+00:00,Yo @Uber_Support: why did I JUST get upcharged for a ride I took on New Years Eve? You just added an extra fee on top of the fee that I already paid for a ride I took 2 weeks ago. Not cool. I’ll be using Lyft from now on!
2018-01-13 12:31:11+00:00,.@Uber_Support another night where I’ve had to go pick up my food from restaurant because a bag was missing! I’m no longer going to use you guys &amp; want a refund

2018-01-12 14:31:21+00:00,Considering the number of articles the Echo do on Delta and the Hackney trade I'm surprised this isn't covered by your colleague @LiamThorpECHO. Shocking.

2018-01-12 00:43:32+00:00,Hi Uber Support. Can we open a customer account that accepts donations from any Uber user so the drivers can be paid for taking people for drivers licenses/ID or to vote. I’ll donate the first $50!!
2018-01-11 22:34:48+00:00,Check your @Uber Receipts My driver must of drove himself home at a cost to me of £215! I don’t live in Guildford! @Uber_Support 
2018-01-11 18:58:43+00:00,I have come to realise that the biggest problem with the @Uber situation is the city. They should make these public areas safe for us. At the CPT airport it’s a very smooth pick and drop. Everybody stands in a designated area for pick ups.
2018-01-11 15:24:18+00:00,@Uber_Support I’ve been waiting outside in the cold for 25 minutes when my Uber said he would be 5 mins.. it keeps going up and down in the time he’s going to get here. When I tried phoning to see where the car was it went through to an automated call service.. 
2018-01-11 15:21:03+00:00,Booked a cab on @Uber and got a cab after 10 mins and had a word with the cab driver where he says “there is lot of traffic on the route you want to travel so better book after half hr” n he cancelled the trip. @Uber_Support kindly look into this matter.
2018-01-11 12:42:28+00:00,"Every month I do my corporate expenses, and every month I hate @Uber_Support for being the only tech company that doesn’t provide easily downloadable receipts, let alone for the double handling of tips. This alone is a reason for not using you for business @Uber"

2018-01-08 22:03:17+00:00,"The dude honestly need to get verbal consent. Like before you pick the person up call out and let them know it's a live streamed uber ride. Who knows, maybe he'd get better content if the passengers are in on it too."
2018-01-08 21:41:23+00:00,"He's also deliberately lying about the camera, for what it's worth. A guy asked what it was, and he responded that it was a dash cam because he was ""almost punched once."""
2018-01-08 21:27:12+00:00,I don't give a shit if he puts a sticker on his car- does he have them on every door? What if someone gets in on the side without a sticker? Are the stickers inside too? Do his passengers have the option to NOT be livestreamed? Why doesn't he tell everyone as they get in the car?
2018-01-08 21:23:51+00:00,"Well if his answers are anything like the sexist/racist ones you get from his mods, you won't get far with that interview."

2018-01-08 20:34:42+00:00,You would think so? The state would say he could record it but (theoretically) twitch should not allow it on their platform
2018-01-08 20:29:39+00:00,Under the guidelines for IRL I thought you weren't allowed to broadcast from a moving vehicle?
2018-01-08 20:11:47+00:00,"I think that's illegal, isn't it? You can report the twitch page, I'm sure. I mean even in the taxi/cab shows where randoms get in, they have to sign a waiver saying they are okay being filmed n whatnot."

2019-12-30 03:56:38+00:00,Dear @Uber @Uber_Support there has to be a way to negatively rate or drivers be charged for cancellation as well. If I stand outside for 10 mins or more and then your driver cancels there has to be something to negatively impacts them just like the consumer. It’s unprofessional..

2019-12-29 20:34:41+00:00,"This may explain the number of times people say ""I will get you on the app"" and then you never see it.

2019-12-29 20:25:59+00:00,Yeah this irritates me. I literally helped her do it. She gave me 5 stars hit the $5 tip and then hit save. I watched her finish the whole process.

2019-12-29 17:00:49+00:00,True. @Uber_India @Uber_Support has worst customer service where women travel and drivers are concerned. We are charged if we cancel. What about when drivers cancel and pass on the buck? I have reverted to normal cabs now.
2019-12-29 13:16:20+00:00,@Uber_India @Uber @Uber_Support Never expected this from @Uber_India . Best action against this driver would be to remove him from Uber service else we boycott @Uber_India

2019-12-26 01:04:04+00:00,No you don’t!!! Your drivers pickup and drop off in illegal and unsafe places everywhere. It’s quite literally rideshare vehicles defining characteristic on the road.

2019-12-06 00:31:49+00:00,So you respond to comments about speed but not the rapes? We see you @Uber

2019-12-05 15:53:24+00:00,Well uber did not send that add on. It seems it was the driver who had that complementary guy with him

I asked @Uber_Support and @AskLyft if they could help when it was $350 and got nothing but silence. So I either continue driving as is and try to earn it, or stop driving altogether."
2019-12-05 02:35:16+00:00,Uber is NOT a TAXI. And NO it’s not a mistake. It’s a normal part of the Uber business model.

2019-12-04 23:37:27+00:00,Your DM is automated and useless. We sent an attorney letter as well as a police report. Please send something other than an automated message and we'll be happy 
2019-12-04 23:25:10+00:00,Lol bull. You said that to her a week ago and she got nothing. You told me you'd follow up on my case and nothing. Prove to us that you do more than comment on a Twitter post that you're getting blasted on

2019-12-04 11:58:45+00:00,Sorry but it’s the norm from this substandard company they haven’t even got a London license anymore So be careful & stay safe avoid UBER

2019-12-03 00:49:53+00:00,We’d love it if we could see exact pickup and drop off addresses when we get the request. We don’t. Drivers want this so we can accept the rides we want and decline those we don’t. Take it up with @Uber @Uber_Support

My Eggsperience order from Anjelica was so unprofessional &amp; never arrived. Not to mention the many times people use fake photos of women &amp; it's a man
2019-12-02 17:05:42+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber I am disgusted at the customer service my boyfriend and I have received for the past few days. You have stolen money from us and accused of lying. When talking to your team our issue was disregarded. We have been charged a cleaning fee for NO MESS being made.
2019-12-02 00:48:07+00:00,"i’m standing, waiting in the rain for my @uber. he passes me &amp; drives 2 blocks away then starts my ride... i try to call multiple times &amp; no answer. he starts driving, ends the ride &amp; CHARGES ME!

2019-12-01 22:22:01+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support why are you ignoring my friend who is trying to reach her driver? 
2019-12-01 22:19:35+00:00,Hey Uber when are you gonna respond to her dms? Her purse with everything she needs is in one of your cars. Act like you care about your customers.
2019-12-01 19:03:37+00:00,Can there be another commercial driving service that can come out soon...this December? @Uber is slacking. Most of them refuse to give us AC. We are being cheated as paying riders. @Uber_Support Also yango is awful. A driver tried to physically assault me the other week. 
2019-12-01 18:18:45+00:00,Meanwhile in London...
2019-12-01 16:29:54+00:00,"Awful customer service! In the future, if an @Uber_Support driver refuses to let me exit the vehicle, should police be called? Why pay for reckless driving so bad it makes someone sick? AND refusing the rider to exit when asked. Sounds like a scam. "
2019-12-01 16:25:44+00:00,@Uber driver was driving recklessly &amp; caused me a to have a panic attack and vomit in his car. Now @Uber_Support is charging me a $150 clean up fee after I requested to exit the car several times before anything happened and it was denied by the driver. Awful driving and company.
2019-12-01 16:19:01+00:00,Are @Uber_Support or @AskLyft participating in cyber Monday?
2019-12-01 16:11:26+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support @Uber! How about adding an option for - or more importantly, AGAINST tinted windows and fragrance or fragrance-FREE vehicles? Tinted windows DO NOT help to protect passengers. And why would a Honda Civic even need blackout windows?? It's just sketchy."

2019-12-01 00:14:27+00:00,Sorry @Uber it was a @lyft lol
2019-11-30 22:26:15+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Uber offered me this and when I utilized one ride they refused to give me this offer. Why offer something you are going to refuse your customer? 
2019-11-30 22:17:54+00:00,So yeah guys that’s basically what happened lol I’m fine I’m safe. It was just weird & crazy & annoying. Shout out to @gendenslow &amp; her mom for rescuing me though &amp; yes I filed a complaint on the Uber app lol @Uber_Support
2019-11-30 21:50:23+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber What if you instructed your drivers to leave child lock off unless children are in the car It's terrifying to find the child lock is on and then your driver doesn't respond the first 5 times you ask him to unlock it with increasing urgency
2019-11-30 07:49:55+00:00,@UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_Support I booked a ride driver started the ride without picking me up. Now I'm charged for it. No option in Uber support. Add otp feature like ola. It had happened multiple times with me.

2019-11-30 06:26:44+00:00,@Uber_Support this is regards to extra amount charged to me against short payments mentioned by driver - for my trip pune to Mumbai on 22 nd Nov 2019 I paid INR 1799 while he updated cash receipt of INR 1500 This lead to making payment of INR 299 
2019-11-30 04:56:55+00:00,It would really be convenient if @uber @Uber_Support @UberEats had a 24/7 customer service call help line cuz it ain’t nobody got time to dm y’all and wait hours for a reply and same on the apps #stepupyourgame

2019-11-28 23:41:25+00:00,can @Uber_Support please explain to me how i can get charged £96 for a 5 minute journey and then let the driver keep my wallet and phone
2019-11-28 17:26:30+00:00,So @Uber_India @Uber_Support u earn enf money from us to get big Mkt spends how abt focusing some energies on the services u provide the customers ?ur drivers accept a trip make us wait 20 mins till they reach us then cancel the trip coz it’s not their home destination 
2019-11-28 12:20:13+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support just charged me $60 for a ride that should’ve been no more than $15. Stupid. Driver said he was waiting in a parking lot for 10 minutes for a ride but it says “busier than usual” as the reason for the elevated fare! Bullshit!!!!!!
2019-11-28 09:51:54+00:00,So annoyed someone just placed themselves in my uber and I’ve been charged the journey while I am still waiting at the airport! @Uber_Support I even watched my driver accept someone else in my taxi despite saying that was the car booked from my phone! 
2019-11-28 07:30:30+00:00,@Uber_Support is blatantly flouting all rules in India under the garb of supply-demand conundrum. Surge pricing is a huge scam. Intriguing that the govt looks the other way. @Uber.

2019-11-28 00:45:47+00:00,So @Uber_Support because I asked for my customer to get a refund on 1017 I cannot ask for my customer on 11/22 to be charged more? There is something very wrong with your system
2019-11-27 21:29:19+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats this is how you got a Uber gold member being picked up this is NASTY I’m so done with #Uber ima just use @lyft for now on bc they care about their customers

2019-11-27 20:19:13+00:00,Man I’m hella bummed @Uber got rid of its ride pass! I use Uber damn near every day. The least they can do is keep some sort of money saving option for commuters! @Uber_Support

2019-11-27 07:24:32+00:00,Curious to hear their response on this! Especially as a frequent uber rider

2019-11-27 02:52:29+00:00,If you took it seriously you would’ve actually done something about it when it was brought up to you. Not to mention if you actually cared at ALL you would background check every driver. I’d start with fixing the issue before doing publicity damage control.
2019-11-27 02:37:11+00:00,girl call them. if you want me to speak for you i will. they do not get to keep your money if you did not receive service. same thing happened to me 2 nights ago & i got a refund.

2019-11-26 22:58:32+00:00,"& when it happened again 3 months later did you respond? You do not take these claims seriously and your company's negligence caused a woman to be molested. this could have been prevented if Uber actually ""cared""."

2019-11-26 22:19:07+00:00,They respond to these kind of tweets and not the real problem. I tweeted about a driver harassing me and my friend and no response. Months later the same driver raped someone.... Uber is a joke.
2019-11-26 20:53:20+00:00,How is @Uber @Uber_Support charging me for a ride I didn’t even get into? These drivers and this app is a scam.
2019-11-26 20:49:54+00:00,THIS is what you responded to?!? Not the original tweet!?
2019-11-26 16:31:42+00:00,love the deafening silence on the original tweet about literal sex trafficking but immediate concern about this joke reply
2019-11-26 14:34:36+00:00,The ride has been booked for a while now. The driver wants to go to noida so he wont come and wont even cancel.. @Uber_Support @Uber why should I cancel or pay the cancellation fee?

2019-11-25 04:03:08+00:00,Good evening @Uber_Support. Since you’re only responding to me via robots on your stupid app I will be tweeting about you until you refund me the doubled price you charged me tonight. I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY!!
2019-11-25 01:38:44+00:00,iCan't
2019-11-25 00:29:33+00:00,make my day lmao
2019-11-24 21:46:35+00:00,"Well: @Uber_Support Another one for the the ""need to regulate platforms"" article: I just lost a phone and the ONLY way to contact the driver is by PHONE number. What absolute a cocking way to manage stuff. Would it kill you to allow email???"
2019-11-24 21:33:49+00:00,"@Uber_Support wtf is the point of asking for utensils if the restaurant doesn’t listen, this has happened one too many times and half the time I order from Uber eats I’m at work and get fucked over if they don’t include utensils. Should be mandatory to include utensils."
2019-11-24 21:31:06+00:00,.@Uber_Support hey! Your Uber driver still hasn’t contact me after admitting he has my iPhone! Uber support hasn’t been helpful either. It’s been 48 hours!...#uberfail
2019-11-24 21:11:32+00:00,I’m waiting @Uber_Support for a phone call. Your driver says I threw up which is crazy because I didn’t sit there and it was raining. 
2019-11-24 21:02:01+00:00,@Uber_Support my daughter is unable 2 use her Uber bc it’s been linked 2 some1 else who she doesn’t knw.This is a major safety issue 4 her.I need IMMEDIATE assist. She’s been told there is nothing that can b done.FIX THIS NOW! BTW having no actual #to@call is sketchy af! #PISSED
2019-11-24 19:13:39+00:00,No they won't and that is not the reason for this tweet.
2019-11-24 19:12:59+00:00,So Harsha Indirectly Saying What He Have To Say About Today's Incident 
2019-11-24 17:56:35+00:00,Did end up having an issue with my @lyft ride the other night...driver didn't hit drop-off so got charged a bit more than expected. @AskLyft decisively corrected the matter in &lt;1 hr. Big thanks! @Uber @Uber_Support took 3 weeks to refuse to do same. Haven't used since
2019-11-24 16:45:33+00:00,Bro yesterday in Paris me and my sister dozed off in our @Uber to the and woke up 40 minutes outside of our route. When I confronted the driver he became aggressive and tried to intimidate me into shutting up. Never felt so scared in an Uber before. @Uber_Support
2019-11-24 14:34:09+00:00,"@Uber_Support I got a Rs. 270 bill for a trip I never when on and sadly they don't have a direct way to contact to support from the app. Add a option call ""I was charged for a ride that never happened"" in the support page. Looks at the route for God sake. Still waiting for a ride "
2019-11-24 11:12:43+00:00,So my #uberdriver basically bounced once she saw me walking towards her car wearing all black from work. She drove by me and waited no more than 5sec then starting speeding like she was scared. Uber charged me $5.25 after she cancelled #uber @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber #uberpool
2019-11-24 04:45:54+00:00,@Uber_Support where’s the “my driver started the trip but didn’t actually pick me up and left me waiting on the side of a highway in the rain and by the time I called another Uber to actually get home the price had almost doubled” category for complaints?
2019-11-24 04:10:57+00:00,The driver was named Natalya
2019-11-23 23:09:14+00:00,Just refund my money so I can delete your stupid app @Uber_Support

2019-11-20 09:47:26+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support my food has been tampered with and I’m genuinely scared to eat it. As well as missing items on my order. The delivery driver looked weird and was being sexually suggestive. Can I have a human contact me as this beyond a “missing items” complaint.
2019-11-20 04:47:08+00:00,Hi friends - please never ever use @Uber scheduled rides. Our driver showed up 20 minutes before we scheduled the ride and we were charged a “wait fee” as a result. And there’s no way to dispute it on @Uber_Support. Just another reason to take Lyft 100% of the time
2019-11-20 03:22:30+00:00,@Uber_Support I was charged for food that never came. The app said the driver waited 8 minutes. I never heard a knock at my door. The order was cancelled without a refund and I never even got a call or text message. How is that good business!? I had three very hungry children!
2019-11-20 02:52:51+00:00,"Today in @Uber drivers are contractors? The app asked me to submit a selfie for verification, a common occurrence.

2019-11-19 13:55:26+00:00,Again @Uber_Support this is NOT support! IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT I DIDNT GET WHAT I PAID FOR! I literally could sue @UberEats because my order was worth more than $20. Fix. This. @dkhos @tonywest @jdroege @jillhazelbaker

2019-11-18 22:48:55+00:00,In the wrong place.
2019-11-18 22:44:58+00:00,I had a special attachment to my headphones and all I want is for my @Uber driver to answer me. Is that too much to ask for? @Uber_Support the wait is unbearable please help me get in touch with Carline. It’s been 3 days!

2019-11-18 16:17:43+00:00,"I wasn't, not even trying to compare. What they went through was not right. I feel for those girls, really wasn't trying to offend anyone."

2019-11-18 15:32:50+00:00,"""Strange Are the Ways of God"" and stranger are the ways of @Uber . Their driver cancels the trip and unsuspecting customer is penalised. Cancellation charges are debited automatically. What an honest deal @Uber_Support @UberFacts @Uber_India"

2019-11-14 21:53:33+00:00,@Uber_Support I just had an Uber driver scream at me and say “how is he supposed to know where I live at” when he has a whole gps saying that it’s showing him the wrong direction. You guys charged me for cancelling when it was not my fault ridiculous!

2019-11-14 16:41:44+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support I had the worst Uber experience thus far

2019-11-14 14:34:15+00:00,"Hello @Uber_Support and @Olacabs. Do you know that drivers in #Guwahati cancel rides with online payment options? After cancellation, they take the passengers on an off app #cashpayment basis. You lose business and passengers are harrased. Do something. @guwahaticity"
2019-11-14 14:08:12+00:00,There should be a panic button in the app that alerts local authorities when a driver is acting reckless or driving off route. It should send the information of the driver and car current location. Let’s get this button added on the app. @AskLyft @lyft @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-11-14 06:25:21+00:00,How before @Uber_Support introduced a mutual preferred driver-rider feature so that drivers and riders who enjoyed each other's company can more often be matched up if they're within range? I have been driven by some quality folks I'd love to see again.

2019-11-13 17:46:03+00:00,"Didn’t knw they had this. Apparently lyft has a critical emergency24/7 service. But driver safety should be separate from rider safety.

2019-11-13 16:56:55+00:00,"Yep it’s helpful. Uber has RideCheck, which is essentially a panic button option."

2019-11-13 11:47:36+00:00,"Calls @Uber ahead of time, driver drives in circles for some reason for 11 minutes, calls me, I give him proper instructions, he cancels on me a minute away from where I am, been waiting in the cold, but oh I get charged $6 for his time? No way thieves. @Uber_Support"
2019-11-13 05:41:12+00:00,"On my way home from work, I saw a cyclist who had been hit by an @Uber driver on 17th and Shotwell. The driver was on the phone with @Uber_Support but had not called 911 yet. WTF. Thank you to @SFFDPIO and @SFPD who responded tonight. "
2019-11-13 05:01:27+00:00,Hello .@Uber_Support @Uber Your service sucks! How about a discount of 25 % everytime your driver cancels? #Uber pic.twitter.com/gRVqFfeBlp
2019-11-13 04:43:55+00:00,I’m just shocked that @lyft @AskLyft @Uber @Uber_Support haven’t answer anyone’s questions on how they’re going to resolve these problems but can retweet other comments about their services
2019-11-13 03:47:25+00:00,Uber allows you to send someone your route info. I send my mom my info every time. She knows where I’m supposed to be going and the arrival time.
2019-11-13 03:29:11+00:00,"@lyft @AskLyft @Uber @Uber_Support no seriously, y’all need to do something about this, this is not okay. DO SOMETHING"
2019-11-13 02:44:19+00:00,There should be a panic button in the app that alerts local authorities. It should send the car and driver information and current location. @AskLyft @lyft @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-11-12 21:41:48+00:00,What’s up with @Uber drivers these days? Quality is through the floor. They call after accepting jobs to ask about your destination and then cancel if it’s not a $50+ trip. @Uber_Support what can be done about this? 
2019-11-12 21:25:39+00:00,No you don’t because that happened to me friday and your support team did nothing!!
2019-11-12 19:56:05+00:00,Same sis. They was right around the corner from my house too 
2019-11-12 17:53:38+00:00,What they meant to say is that they take it serious if it goes viral
2019-11-12 15:36:11+00:00,Anybody apparently
2019-11-12 15:19:39+00:00,Exactly!!! Happened to me about two weeks ago after waiting an hour for the food. The woman picked up my order and told the restaurant I cancelled (a lie) then she still took the food with her and apparently cancelled the order. All I got was a “We’re sorry this happened.”
2019-11-12 15:05:06+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support we’re all STILL waiting for an option in-app to filter out drivers with surveillance devices in their vehicles. Tired of having to cancel when the driver arrives (sometimes incurring a fee), wasting both our times and then having to wait for another. "
2019-11-12 15:03:27+00:00,Did you really just make that assumption? I know how to cook and cook well. God forbid people get take out once in a while. pic.twitter.com/D4uz76cVvS
2019-11-12 14:35:09+00:00,That’s why knowing how to cook is essential 
2019-11-12 14:32:04+00:00,Doordash is always trash no matter where I am. All of these services are trash tbh.
2019-11-12 13:39:19+00:00,I guess it matters about location and where you live. Cause Door dash always been great on my side
2019-11-12 13:32:20+00:00,@Uber @UberEats so you telling me I can’t trust y’all to get in an Uber without almost being kidnapped and I can’t trust my food getting in an Uber without it being eaten before it’s delivered. Y’all have a lot of kinks to work out. Throw the whole company away 
2019-11-12 13:04:57+00:00,"Ok. So the cancellation fee is waived off. Got a call too where I discussed the issue in details. But, in first place this should not happen with anyone. Why should anyone be charged when driver cancels the trip? Anyway, thanks for the resolution. @Uber_Support"
2019-11-12 12:58:04+00:00,mmh they real silent now
2019-11-12 12:41:05+00:00,"No, you don’t. This happened to me 2 weeks ago & I’m still fired up about it. I called Uber Support minutes after my order was mysteriously “cancelled” after the estimated delivery time & nothing was done. You need to have safeguards cause drivers are out here eatin ppl’s food!"
2019-11-12 11:48:30+00:00,This is a common practise these days. 8/10 cabbies refuse the trip from LGBI airport if the destination isn't 20-25 KM's away.
2019-11-11 23:44:24+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support you can’t charge me a $5 cancellation fee when my driver refuses to meet me at my pick up spot! That’s just poor customer service.
2019-11-11 20:42:19+00:00,"Thank you @Uber_Support for helping to resolve my recent situation!!! I appreciate all the time and attention you gave me!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!! @Uber"
2019-11-11 18:10:14+00:00,I took an @Uber trip on Saturday and my driver decided to take me on a tour of London with several loops involved. Apparently @Uber_Support think it’s acceptable I’m actually laugggghhhing at this map. 
2019-11-11 17:16:33+00:00,I put too much sugar in tea once. Still haven't forgiven myself. Imagine what I'd be like if I carved up a journalist or had a product my company made kill a cyclist? @Uber_Support 
2019-11-11 16:42:33+00:00,"Rather than following up on each incident individually, why not just implement a way of fixing the issue on the wider scale? Better for everyone "
2019-11-11 16:04:49+00:00, that escalated quickly
2019-11-11 15:28:25+00:00,"These aren’t isolated incidents, people leave these bikes wherever they want with no regard to access. Pavements are built to such certain standards, that placement of a bike generally impacts on what is required for wheelchairs. Uber need to do more."
2019-11-11 08:16:46+00:00,Hello @Uber_Support. I'd like to complain about a CEO. 
2019-11-11 04:29:49+00:00,@Uber_Support your CEO says Uber accidentally dismembers dissidents. Help.
2019-11-10 10:51:58+00:00,"Hate doing this here, but getting nowhere on the app @Uber_Support @Uber can you tell me why this driver took this route at 4am when the streets are clear, and why you aren’t processing a refund for me? He took advantage of sleeping passengers. £35 credit doesnt quite cut it.."
2019-11-10 10:03:07+00:00,"Just imagine a significant amount of women boycotted @uber_uganda services.Would that make you realise that our lives matter,that customers are key regardless of gender .."
2019-11-10 08:58:34+00:00,"Hi @Uber @Uber_Support your people are at it again, what is this thing of them asking us where we're going when accepting trips? If he doesn't want to take me where I want, he should not accept trips, it's unacceptable and it's not the first time I bring this to your attention. https://twitter.com/akreana_/status/1081598051322679297"
2019-11-10 08:34:14+00:00,Thank you. I contacted @Boltapp_ng almost as soon as it happened. They're yet to get back to me. I contacted @Uber_Support later. And they're following up.
2019-11-10 04:59:22+00:00,@Uber_Support So what happens when a driver steals an item and then turns around and sells it on Offer Up?
2019-11-10 03:18:41+00:00,Good evening @Uber_Support and @UberEats I placed an order #A3493 tonight and this is how it was delivered. I have yet to get a response via the help section on the app. Please advise.
2019-11-10 01:35:45+00:00,"Dear @Uber_Support if I request a car with a CAR SEAT why is this all that’s showing up. My daughter is 5 months old. She doesn’t need a booster seat, she needs a car seat. Which is why I clicked car seat. So why am I being told by drivers “dont put her in there, just hold her” "
2019-11-09 22:59:01+00:00,This is insane @Uber_Support. Again?! And Tolga’s name isn’t blocked because we made eye contact and he sped off as I reached for my cart to start unloading my stuff 
2019-11-09 21:10:54+00:00,Those who are coming to Ghana this year...most of the Uber drivers have stopped providing AC. They will give you all types of ridiculous excuses. I’m just giving you a heads up. @Uber_Ghana @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-11-09 13:38:16+00:00,"The audacity of @UberEats @Uber_Support to refuse to refund my money when my order never arrived . They claimed that they've noticed a ""high frequency of refunds"" on my account (THIS IS MY FIRST TIME) but when I asked them to prove it, they don't. Thieving cunts. pic.twitter.com/4LKKMT9XJh"
2019-11-09 13:30:55+00:00,"The fact that @uber_uganda @Uber_Support reads all this and doesn't change scares me. People are getting hurt, lives are in danger but nothing changes. Hope your friend is feeling better."
2019-11-09 13:24:51+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support this is effing ridiculous! I was also a passenger in this car and if getting detained twice by customs is considered “a route that seems to fit” for a simple trip back to our hotel, you’re trippin— FIX IT "
2019-11-09 09:19:41+00:00,Just how they cancel the ride without informing to rider @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_SL FYI
2019-11-09 07:26:13+00:00,@Uber_Support Not happy. Had two Uber eats orders in a row get cancelled over the span of an hour and a half. Waited over an hour for the last order to just get cancelled. Now it’s 2:30 am and no place around me is opened...
2019-11-09 04:18:52+00:00,"I managed to leave my phone in my @Uber last night after celebrating at the Marine Corps Ball and they – along with their excellent driver Shah – went out of their way to ensure that I got it back and with a full charge! Thank you, @Uber_Support. #RideWithUber"
2019-11-09 01:54:28+00:00,"Hello @robicellis please send us a private message so you stop talking about this publicly, shhhhh, secret secret thank you"
2019-11-08 23:14:15+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support (@UberEats) just following up... what is your number?
2019-11-08 21:28:45+00:00,"You think I actually ordered this? I saw it and closed the app expeditiously. Took a lyft, which was only $30 and change."
2019-11-08 19:52:18+00:00,So I go back and forth with @Uber_Support for DAYS about a bad experience and driver. I finally get an automated response today ... and a $3 credit. Thanks? 
2019-11-07 22:09:24+00:00,So seriously you don't have a number people can call when they were in an accident FIVE DAYS AGO?
2019-11-07 22:04:11+00:00,My sister @inanimatecub was in a car accident in an @Uber_Support with her bf Sat night and still hasn't been able to reach Uber so DELETE YOUR APPS FAM and help us get the insurance she and the BF need.
2019-11-07 21:53:21+00:00,"ever since they allowed uber drivers to cancel consequence free, uber drivers cancel on you after seeing you (racist) and after calling to see where you're going (discrimination). Basically, what made us flee traditional cabs in the first place."
2019-11-07 21:21:35+00:00,"I am furious. @Uber_Support stated ""I understand how annoying is for you that you were regarding the discriminatory and dangerous ride situation for you"" and gave me THREE DOLLARS in Uber credit. Annoying for me?! I was thrown out of a ride during a low bg event. #doc"
2019-11-07 19:28:30+00:00,"I have now, after 2 weeks, received SIX separate @Uber_Support emails from DIFFERENT people asking for the SAME information about being kicked out of a ride for low BG. This is unacceptable. #doc"

2019-11-07 17:59:33+00:00,I did that last time. And the time before. Nothing changes. I got a generic response about doing everything you can. Why don’t you charge drivers when they cancel like you charge riders? @AddisonLeeCabs have made a ton out of me recently.
2019-11-07 16:44:08+00:00,Every few days I do a search on #Twitter of the following key words: #uber #stole #phone It's funny to read these tweets to @Uber_Support from people claiming the @Uber driver stole their phone when in reality they just left it in the car. They just can't take #responsibility
2019-11-07 15:32:47+00:00,"Me: *tells @Uber_Support that one of their drivers held my phone for ransom and I have proof* Uber’s response, three days later: "

2019-11-07 14:37:07+00:00,Everyone please share this and make @Uber_Support understand this is unacceptable please. 
2019-11-07 14:36:28+00:00,With appropriate video footage you really should allow cyclists and other vulnerable road users to give driver rating feedback on your drivers. Might even improve how some of them drive.
2019-11-07 09:47:34+00:00,That’s true..it’s pretty common in Punjab. I took the pic of @Uber_India car with Bhindranwala pic in Chandigarh last week. @Uber_Support 
2019-11-07 03:38:46+00:00,"Dear @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber , when we cancel a ride, you charge us a cancellation fee, but my driver just cancelled and now I'm late to work, don't you think you should pay us a compensation fee ? Think on it."
2019-11-07 03:00:55+00:00,"Update: @Uber_Support reached out immediately, offered an apology &amp; a $5 credit (I was never charged for the cancellation). Great customer service but this driver had 5000+ rides &amp; 4.9 rating. Pulling these stunts at an airport should NEVER be tolerated &amp; he should be penalized."
2019-11-07 02:13:52+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support And I'm not saying he cancelled the trip cause I'm a young black man in a hoodie. But it is 2019, there's a racist in the White House, and racism is alive and well. So yeah the thought crossed my mind "
2019-11-06 22:32:07+00:00,You should get a refund on those shoes
2019-11-06 21:12:17+00:00,Report to police. This is illegal

2019-11-06 11:03:44+00:00,That was the plan you cheapskate.
2019-11-06 08:51:49+00:00,Had some truly awful customer service from Uber Eats' @Uber_Support. Delivery driver gave the wrong order to me and they now refuse to compensate. This is surely a violation of trading standards? Goods and service not fulfilled?
2019-11-06 06:11:22+00:00,Hi guys I really need your help! My sister forgot her laptop bag and important documents in an Uber. She has been struggling to contact the driver since yesterday morning.

2019-11-06 02:01:33+00:00,I know you can't address this over social. You all didn't address this when she was calling & sending emails in private. I posted that so everyone else can know if they get hit while working for you they're on their own.

2019-11-05 19:59:02+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support I refuse to use your app when you overcharge and misrepresent the price of the ride. A $30 ride turned into a $60 dollar ride. Transparency needs to be a top priority. @lyft is going to be used next time for me
2019-11-05 18:33:43+00:00,Wrong fully charged 42 cancellation fee when driver refused and tricked me @Uber_Support this is disgusting i need immediate support. Driver Name Bittu he asked me drop location and mode of payment and hunged the call. I tried calling him didn’t pick then canceled the call.
2019-11-05 17:32:36+00:00,oi @Uber_Support just give me the chicken you owe me you pagans
2019-11-05 17:28:31+00:00,I’ve been through your internal process and apparently @Uber can just take £110 from me and give a me generic copy and pasted response!

2019-11-05 13:26:14+00:00,Can’t believe I’ve been charged £110 by @Uber for causing a mess inside the vehicle which wasn’t even me. Disgraceful that the drivers can get away with this #vomitfraud @TfL @Uber_Support @BBCNews @Enfield_Indy @SadiqKhan

2019-11-05 12:31:59+00:00,Booked a @Uber for my sister as she is not feeling well because of food poison. The driver refused to start trip saying he has to travel in opposite direction. I informed multiple times to driver about my sister's health. @Uber_Support @Uber should be ashamed

2019-11-05 07:33:53+00:00,@Uber_Support Your driver misbehaved with me on the trip and while getting down says sorry and then puts a wrong feedback against me and you assholes send me a threatening email? Do you think there is no other car hire or mode of transport other than @Uber in the world?

2019-11-05 00:32:33+00:00,All of those actions taken. In my case Uber Canada falls under “global” requiring a *written paper request* (really!!) to Netherlands office (wtf) outlining my data request. It was ignored. Facebook and Twitter provided me with my data for police and crown attorney.

2019-10-26 01:56:34+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support should I start charging you after 2 minutes like you do? Should I wait for a guy who’s is parked on the corner waiting for the cancellation fee? Or should I cancel and wait for you to charge me? Give me a hint 
2019-10-26 01:24:53+00:00,Incident? Uber. This is a blessing.

It's a #symptom I been observing for sometime now. It's #feedback. Hope it improves. @Uber @Uber_Support #uberindia #CustomerExperience
2019-10-12 09:57:05+00:00,"Mario had been at this location for the past 35 minutes and if I cancel, I’ll be charged $25USD. YO @Uber @Uber_Support help me with this. "
2019-10-12 09:32:27+00:00,"That’s how @Uber_Support @UberNigeria sent me useless promo code. Kuku don’t add me to your promo statistics than have me think about the amount of money I could have saved this week... Plus don’t come and ask me useless question in dm o, I complained on Monday nothing happened"
2019-10-12 09:08:41+00:00,"No that is now the normal price. They have to add 20% VAT now. Google it, announced this week. Lots of people are #DeleteUber because of this."
2019-10-12 08:24:00+00:00,I understand that none but me bears the responsibility of losing something in the cab but your response that the driver prtner is not responding to calls is the highest order of worst customer support. @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber_Chennai
2019-10-11 18:27:37+00:00,Really Good Job @UberEats @Uber_India @Uber @Uber_Support Keep Support who are ready to inspire The real singapenny #uber #UberEats #ubereats #Singappenney @Lyricist_Vivek @Atlee_dir @arrahman @archanakalpathi @aishkalpathi @agscinemas @Ags_production – at Ags Cinemas
2019-10-11 18:22:08+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support your twitter responses are just to make you look good. Getting anything out of you direct is a nightmare!
2019-10-11 16:18:30+00:00,yo @Uber_Support got a new phone and the app won’t let me log in on my account. its asking to create a new one and i don’t want that! what should i do?
2019-10-11 16:12:19+00:00,Just had my worst experience with UberEats yet. I used to drive for UberEats and never done anything like this. He avoided the toll to save $1 and then told me to cancel. All I know is @Uber_Support @Uber @UberEats need to get some quality control in there.
2019-10-11 13:11:08+00:00,Damn these @Uber drivers. Four cancellations in last 15 minutes. Unprofessional lot! @Uber_Support
2019-10-11 12:22:10+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber - will I get my money back from a ride I tried to communicate with that the driver cancelled and still charged me $10 for? Was at the location for pickup yet couldn't locate me
2019-10-11 11:01:37+00:00,It’s too early for this @Uber_Support Then proceeded to tell me to google his car to look at the space. Tuh. You show up to an airport and expect people to have no bags? 
2019-10-11 09:14:49+00:00,You said that last week and nothing happened
2019-10-11 08:32:58+00:00,Nothing like getting a message from your @Uber driver to say they’re outside.. then getting outside and they’ve driven off and ‘cancelled’ the trip... @Uber_Support please let your drivers know that some people aren’t as able to get outside so quickly for mobility reasons
2019-10-11 06:49:32+00:00,I wear mine in rear sear
2019-10-11 02:03:54+00:00,"Hope you're okay. Uber will not take this seriously, consider a restraining order too and maybe getting your local news involved."
2019-10-11 00:58:07+00:00,Just called @Uber_Support AGAIN and not taken seriously because I found a USED meth pipe in my @UberEats order and they think that just refunding me the purchase cost is enough compensation ?! Are you kidding me? Do I need to start finding a lawyer or a news channel?
2019-10-11 00:39:47+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support suggest you include a feature “cab has/ doesn’t have #seatbelts” when a trip notification shows up. Cancelled 2 trips this morning because cabs had no pax #seatbelts. #paxlivesmatter
2019-10-10 22:44:21+00:00,"Oh there you are. I’ve called you, I’ve gone through your app, I’ve tried to write through your website and it’s ONLY when I take to Twitter that you listen. What about all your other customers who aren’t on Twitter? I’m so angry. I’m going to bed. I’ll deal with you tomorrow."
2019-10-10 20:46:42+00:00,So my @Uber driver had to cancel my trip (totally fine) but then Uber tells me I have to reschedule my ride and now the prices are surged since I first ordered one. Be better than this @Uber_Support
2019-10-10 20:11:17+00:00,Adding to this thread now that it’s exploded.... @Uber_Support have not contacted me regarding this today. The money did however leave the bank account today after it was initially blocked for being suspicious on Sunday.
2019-10-10 19:45:12+00:00,"Requesting @Uber_Support @Uber_India to kindly take action. After I booked the Uber, the driver called me, asked where I need to go, after I told him my destination, he cancelled the ride. This is becoming standard practice now. Attaching screenshot of driver details. Thanks."
2019-10-10 14:48:53+00:00,well apart from this tweet they've still not responded anywhere else. I'm tired of it tbh
2019-10-10 14:47:57+00:00,Funny how @Uber now get in touch with you when it's public and realise you are a person people listen too.
2019-10-10 13:21:32+00:00,You paid @Uber to be kidnapped is what I’m seeing.
2019-10-10 13:12:15+00:00,Thanks everyone for their support in this Uber fiasco. They've still not made an attempt to contact me about it. I'm not chasing them anymore - they have my phone number already. @Uber_Support @Uber

2019-10-10 09:44:06+00:00,So I had over £1000 fraudulently taken from my bank account by @UberUK on Friday @Uber_Support @UberUKsupport
2019-10-10 09:12:34+00:00,Kudos to @Uber_Support They acted swiftly on my yesterday’s complaint and made a refund. Nice one.

2019-10-09 20:35:01+00:00,I’m super frustrated with @Uber lack of customer service. There is no phone number to speak with @Uber_Support and I am tired of trying to resolve a fraudulent charge on my account after a month. #HelpMe
2019-10-09 16:47:31+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support Please talk to your employees. They are very disrespectful. If they don't want to drive anymore they must leave. 
2019-10-09 16:13:05+00:00,Not sure why @Uber @Uber_Support get such a big cut and we the drivers get the short end of the stick! They have to do better.
2019-10-09 16:03:39+00:00,"Hey everyone, just an FYI that @Uber @Uber_Support is the worst! Someone redeemed all of my credit card points and they basically are just like “lol u used these points on these past 5 trips in GEORGIA”"
2019-10-09 14:51:44+00:00,"I will wait to see your actions, if I’m not satisfied; we will meet ourselves here again soon. @Uber_Support "
2019-10-09 12:00:28+00:00,"Another day, another @Uber driver trying to pull the old ""short stop"" trick of parking several blocks away, ignoring me or pretending he cant find me, and waiting for me to cancel so he gets the cancel fee money! @Uber_Support what are you doing to combat this behavior? "
2019-10-09 07:58:04+00:00,@noida_authority Taxies and cabs are ruining the dust free zone / grass area in sector 137. Please install barrier/fencing /kerb stones to discourage parking in these areas. @CeoNoida. @ola_supports @Uber_Support please instruct your drivers not to park here. 
2019-10-09 07:26:30+00:00,"And @Uber_India @Uber_Support was after your driver virtually ran out of gas, stopped for a refill &amp; I got late for a meeting. Seriously, you folks should be ashamed of yourselves."
2019-10-09 05:39:27+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support yesterday I lost my purse inside cab during my trip from Shahdara to Laxmi Nagar. There is no response from driver also from UBER. My purse was found at Lal quila roadside without money. What is your action plan?
2019-10-09 00:28:17+00:00,"That's the battle cry of people who are failures in life. ""Aww...c'mon man. Just take the shitty food you paid and tipped me to bring because if I get in trouble my life will get worse."" Too fucking bad, ain't it? Git gud at life my guy."
2019-10-09 00:27:20+00:00,"I'm like ""Dude I ordered this food an hour ago on @UberEats - It's cold and soggy now and I don't want it."" And the GUY...not the woman who's technically my Uber driver but the GUY who is actually driving her starts being like ""Aww c'mon man."""
2019-10-08 20:23:08+00:00,What's big issue is how @Uber_Support @Uber allowed to accept this guy registration for Job as driver without cross verification of proper Id proof &amp; verification. That shows @Uber @Uber_Support do not follow any proper guidelines And this endangers life &amp; security of citizens
2019-10-08 20:14:34+00:00,Just imagine the Security nightmare @PIBHomeAffairs The person who got employed by @Uber_Support as driver of Swift Dzire has a different name all together Uber name : Imran Khan Name in Driving licence : Sazid Khan This culprit might be a illegal bangladeshi Or a Rohingya 
2019-10-08 20:11:15+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support is unsafe for women passengers now.. The brother of the girl in a series of tweets naratted the horrific incident of near abduction of her sister by this jihadi but due to God's grace she was saved due to 2 bikers who intervened 
2019-10-08 20:10:28+00:00,Lol been waiting for a week to hear back from @Uber_Support - charged me $50 for a 15 MIN BIKE RIDE. Whys Twitter the only way to get customer service now? Keep getting “thanks for your patience!” Responses but can’t use uber or uber eats because of this. Officially deleting uber
2019-10-08 15:53:28+00:00,Booked an Uber 13 minutes ago and paid for it using Apple Pay and the driver was on the way and now it says I have no upcoming trips even though the money has gone out of my bank??? @Uber @Uber_Support 
2019-10-08 09:21:15+00:00,".@nitin_gadkari ji, This is Serious crime by @Uber. Please don't let go without proper explanation &amp; action. Tighten their Noose. Ma'am @smritiirani what will it take for @sharmarekha ji, to step in? cc @HMOIndia @PMOIndia"
2019-10-08 08:36:51+00:00,Lol.. such fakery to absolve the M religionists by bringing in false equivalence.
2019-10-08 08:27:22+00:00,"@prakhar_jain13 is a typical bootlicker who comes up with a manufactured story to justify the criminal activity of the muslim driver. Open challenge to this loser to file a case against the driver he's talking about. He wont, coz this coward was lying"
2019-10-08 04:11:52+00:00,@HMOIndia AADHAR could have played huge role.On click you would know Civil&amp; Criminal cases as they are repeat offenders who also get emboldened when many do not report.Muslim-Mewat is a criminal den.These guys would come in tempo with mattress and take turn on helpless Delhi Lady

2019-10-07 22:56:18+00:00,Uber have no proper call centre and their security are pathetic. I have experienced many weird incidents
2019-10-07 19:10:13+00:00,Similar incident happened with my friend.
2019-10-07 19:06:44+00:00,Stop travelling with Pussssslimmms.

2019-10-07 17:58:43+00:00,"Aashish, care to share the entire story when you're free and if willing, because girls need to know what goes wrong and when to raise an alarm. It will help. Hope your sister is alright."
2019-10-07 17:41:40+00:00,Hope your sis is okay man.
2019-10-07 17:23:59+00:00,Sad and horrified to see such misuse of @Uber. It should be their responsibility since we are trusting @Uber and not the cab driver. High time that they start taking accountability and scan crooked drivers
2019-10-07 10:53:46+00:00,"Anyone else been hit by the @Uber clean up fee scam? Took an Uber last Friday and have been charged £80 for a mess we didn’t make! @Uber_Support are just palming me off, despite this fraud."
2019-10-06 22:14:47+00:00,"Shame on you @Uber. After a recent ride, you adjusted the fare by $31.22 in additional tolls, nearly doubling the total for the ride. Showed that the tolls at most should be $6.77 you wouldn’t explain how it happened. Riders beware! @Uber_Support"
2019-10-06 13:41:14+00:00,So how many people u about to do this with cuz it happens to all of us.TOOOOOOO FREEEDOOOOMMM!!!!!
2019-10-06 08:43:39+00:00,@Uber_Support simply reviewing when a customer raises it and giving this one driver a slap on the wrist is not working for @ellenffb and her community. You need to be more proactive with this across your company culture.
2019-10-06 07:36:29+00:00,"We absolutely want to follow up right away, @JAYVERSACE. Please send us a DM with your email address, phone number and the location where this particular incident happened so we can connect."
2019-10-06 05:32:49+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I was charged for a trip I never took. The guy never showed up and charged me for the entire trip. Wtf?
2019-10-06 05:13:32+00:00,So sorry to hear this has happened YET AGAIN. @Uber @Uber_Support please fix this ASAP.
2019-10-06 04:28:06+00:00,hey someone stole my uber @Uber_Support

2019-10-05 23:39:06+00:00, Watching to see how this is handled. Unacceptable.
2019-10-05 21:20:12+00:00,That was a first. Got into @Uber and driver said he needed to stop at the police because someone left a phone...and we also had to stop and see his wife! We got out at a random restaurant and got another car. I was still charged $12! @Uber_Support

2019-10-05 13:08:45+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber_Ireland @gardainfo My account (along with others in Ireland) has been hacked. I am being charged for trips that I have not taken. Can you please refund my account. You have been unresponsive in the support section of the app
2019-10-05 07:34:02+00:00,Hello @Uber_Support How can this case has been closed while I have yet to receive your reply...after 2 months? $70 was deducted from my bank account for order that I didn’t place 
2019-10-05 07:27:16+00:00,@Uber_Support @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_India you people have no shame whatsoever. It's 2019 and yet you cannot build an automated system to deliver monthly travel reports to your customers. @Olacabs send a monthly receipt in the first day of the month without fail.
2019-10-04 23:13:01+00:00,"Just had 4 @Uber drivers pick up my ride request and then immediately cancel them. Each one charging me $7.15.

2019-10-04 10:49:07+00:00,Book an @Uber. Driver call and checks drop location. Doesn’t bother to cancel or start trip and I get this for waiting on road. At least check your maps to see if your driver actually started or not. Pathetic!!! @Uber_Support

2019-10-02 15:00:55+00:00,"Oh look, an @Uber driver sitting in the bike lane in the middle of rush hour. What do you think, @Uber_Support ? (hint: you don't care) Sticker was on the front windshield. "
2019-10-02 09:03:57+00:00, another ubered passenger!! When will people learn!!!
2019-10-02 00:27:41+00:00,£416 but it’s cheap 
2019-10-01 23:32:04+00:00,"@Uber_Support @Uber promised me my money back and my next few rides free. They said it was automatically on my account and didn’t have to do anything. When I took an Uber, money was taken from my bank account. LOL."
2019-10-01 17:51:08+00:00,Wait. Has Uber eats stopped delivering McDonald’s?? @Uber_Support I need answers
2019-10-01 16:12:35+00:00,Why a DM? Do your business in public so we can all watch.
2019-10-01 15:55:13+00:00,"If you really do, you would already have something in place to get this driver off of our streets. I’m tired of this and your company congesting our streets with bad drivers."
2019-10-01 15:42:21+00:00,the “okay” 
2019-10-01 15:41:02+00:00,"It is important to know that banning private vehicles on Market Street is paramount more than ever. This @Uber_Support and @lyft driver threatened me with his vehicle. His excuse, “This road is fair game and get out of my way.” I’m only sharing this because I am alive to do so."
2019-10-01 15:37:49+00:00,Okay.
2019-10-01 14:56:32+00:00,"@Uber_Support please explain to me why I was charged for a ride I DID NOT take, why I am being refused my money back, and why your customer support keeps closing the conversation as though I have been helped"
2019-10-01 13:53:45+00:00,Your customer service is absolutely terrible. @uber @Uber_Support
2019-10-01 12:48:12+00:00,answer me u dafties @Uber_Support
2019-10-01 11:19:58+00:00,Day two of @UberUK @Uber_Support not responding to my request for a refund for the ride my driver never arrived for. Please refund my €57 Uber! I’ve not had a single response to my 4 messages to you on your ‘24/7’ contact platform. Embarrassing! 
2019-10-01 09:22:40+00:00,"#Women aren’t #safe in @Uber_India cabs! This driver - 90042 84923 has harassed me to an extent that now he refuses to answer my calls and @Uber_Support has failed in helping me for almost a month now, they choose to harass women instead of contacting the driver &amp; fixing it"
2019-10-01 08:26:23+00:00,Hello @Uber_Support Can you also send a mail to the users highlighting what were the changes in T&amp;C w.e.f today. It is difficult to hunt down some changes inserted surreptitiously
2019-10-01 05:06:31+00:00,You are ordering a driver and a sat nav that's it... To presume or expect anything more is foolish on your part !!
2019-09-30 17:00:56+00:00,I do not know what kind of Black Magic you are doing over there @Uber_Support but I just looked at my bank account and my fare had been fully credited and no late cancellation fee charged.... Impressive.
2019-09-30 14:01:16+00:00,"Direct quote from @Uber_Support today, as I’m working to file a police report and gather further information: “As this case is almost a year old, @Uber considers it resolved.” No, Uber, my assault is not resolved and you will also be held accountable."
2019-09-30 12:18:14+00:00,"Your sorry excuse for a driver kept me waiting over 40 minutes, missed the pickup location, refused to answer my calls, kept driving away and cancelled. I was charged cancellation. Pathetic @Uber_India. I want a compensation for the hour I lost @Uber_Support @Uber @UberINSupport"
2019-09-30 09:17:57+00:00,"Made a friend tonight thanks to @Uber ...pool, the uber driver pulled over and made the homosexual passenger get out and pulled a taser on him, I got out to say it’s wrong and driver sped away... @Uber_Support we ended up in another pool and driver was upset. WTF UBER?"
2019-09-30 08:21:49+00:00,"Happens all the time. Bad incentives drive bad behaviour, inevitably resulting in a bad service. Bad service drives customers to competitors. #WhereIsMyRefund?"
2019-09-30 08:00:32+00:00,Someone at @Uber_Support needs to message me. So drivers can cancel my trip when I’ve been waiting for 10+ mins but I can’t cancel otherwise I get charged. I also walked to my uber in the Rain coz he said he can’t get to me and I got charged extra coz I made the guy wait???
2019-09-30 03:28:03+00:00,This is getting increasingly very frustrating @Uber_India @Uber_Mumbai @Uber_Support cab drivers refuse to accept bookings when there is no surge or minor surge! Mornings are a disaster. The drivers told us expressly they wouldn't. And classic is don't turn up after knowing destn
2019-09-30 02:35:56+00:00,"If @Uber_SL doesn't have a hotline for instant complains, people will drift away from it. @Uber @Uber_Support"
2019-09-30 01:40:26+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support would really like help with this issue. I dm’d like requested, and have received no response..."
2019-09-30 01:12:22+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support I WAS CHARGED A FEE FOR “BODILY FLUIDS” FOR WATER IM THE CAR AFTER BEING PICKED UP FROM A WATER PARK. THIS IS RIDUCLOUS AND A SCAM. YOUR WEBSITE CLEARLY SAYS POOL OR SEA WATER MAY BE CHARGED UP TO $50 &amp; I DO NOT APPRECIATE THE JIP. #SCAMMERS #HORRIBLESERVICE
2019-09-30 00:37:42+00:00,Just a quick little follow up @Uber_Support 
2019-09-29 20:48:57+00:00,Imagine in this economy refusing a job because Some customers live upstairs
2019-09-29 20:41:14+00:00,"Absolitely disgusted with @Uber_Support today. One cancelled. One saying I’m on a trip (which I wasn’t). I cancelled last one, and billed for the privilege. Charming. "
2019-09-29 19:46:09+00:00,"@Uber_Support utter joke, I have no friends or family in London and no one but me uses my credit card - 4 transactions where where not me off my credit card and this is all you can come up with. "
2019-09-29 12:40:45+00:00,"When you see a car speeding towards the window next to someone you really care about, you do not think “well, this driver took a calculated risk!” You thank god, your lucky stars, and a superb driver keeping calm in the face of someone else racing through a stop sign"
2019-09-29 07:49:12+00:00,@Uber_Support I live in the middle of 4 McDonald’s restaurants and not one of them delivers to my road but they deliver to the roads around my road! Can you change this please 
2019-09-29 06:57:27+00:00,Omg I love getting kicked out of my @Uber for being gay :))) I also loved being kicked my him :// @Uber_Support GIVE ME A REFUND
2019-09-29 04:31:46+00:00,"Please refrain from calling them Taxis. They are Private Hire, and the majority of their drivers are not even local, so wouldn’t know the areas they’re working in. Why not use a local firm in future. Keep your money local."
2019-09-29 04:16:19+00:00,You need to stay with the police on this one and get a lawyer. #Uber has a team that specializes in sweeping these matters under the rug. Read this story that just came out this week.
2019-09-29 01:32:51+00:00,I know I’m not alone in this (see the article below). @Uber_Support and @AskLyft is there a way to comment on this after a ride without the driver being penalized?
2019-09-28 20:11:41+00:00,I’m so pissed an Uber accepted my ride and said it dropped me off and everything but I never got in and I was still charged $27 for it ... @Uber @Uber_Support @uber_phx
2019-09-28 17:41:04+00:00,What are you guys doing to make sure you’re not hiring homophobic drivers? If I was a gay man getting picked up by him who knows how my night would’ve ended. That’s not okay.
2019-09-28 17:33:52+00:00,last night on the way to a GAY club our uber driver spent the whole fucking ride telling us that gay men aren’t valid and women can “change” from being lesbians... I’m sorry but did I ask for a bible lecture or a uber ride?? @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-09-28 16:16:38+00:00,Uber please explain why my UBER is lost for not taking the 407. I don’t understand why I have the worst luck with this app. I have an appointment in 15 min what a joke #fuckuber @Uber_Support @Uber
2019-09-28 15:37:55+00:00,@Uber_Support guys I've dropped you a DM as I've been over charged for my trip by $80!
2019-09-28 15:23:32+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support this is NOT okay!!! 
2019-09-28 08:45:30+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @Olacabs From last 2 trip after waiting 20 min. Driver having drop near me. After completing his trip then he cal me ask for destination. If u refuse to say destination location he cancel trip. If we cancel we get charged and what about you uber?
2019-09-28 05:23:19+00:00,"@Uber_Support @Ola_Chennai Are you aware that in Chennai, your cabbies cancel rides if it's a digital payment. I've recordings where they explicitly ask for cash. If you can't solve this, please remove the delusional option of digital payments."
2019-09-28 03:20:43+00:00,Really? @Uber_Support @MyUberAdventure
2019-09-28 02:25:33+00:00,"Lol @uber has a pathetic “your ride is late” AFTER you’re picked up (so no cancelling without taking your money). No shit it’s late, you picked a driver 30 minutes away and promised it would take 35 to take me 10 minutes away you dumb service! Not cool @Uber_Support"
2019-09-28 01:23:29+00:00,Got charged for cancellation fee that I didn't cancel and then for a trip that the driver didn't show up for. @Uber sort this out. Had to go elsewhere... thank goodness. Can't rely on @Uber no more @Uber_Support @UberUK
2019-09-27 23:28:27+00:00,Reading driver threads in hopes of figuring out why I've suddenly been blocked from instant pay (bc driver forums are litery more helpful than @Uber_Support is) Here are some of the outlandish explanations drivers have gotten from @Uber regarding inability to access instant pay
2019-09-27 23:14:09+00:00,So @UberEats @Uber_Support @Uber is NOT paying their drivers this pm after deliveries are made and gas is spent?!? #UberEats名古屋 #ubereats #uber #UberEatsPromoCode
2019-09-27 22:43:50+00:00,WHEN will #Uber be operating in #Vancouver ?? ANYONE???? @Uber @Uber_Support @UberFacts
2019-09-27 19:47:00+00:00,Don't understand why this guy has a 4.88 rating @Uber_Support He was my driver on the way to party last night and without any provocation went on a completely misogynistic rant. Reported in app. Heads up for anyone who gets him this week at Twitch Con. 
2019-09-27 17:50:12+00:00,Placed order around 10pm. Latest delivery was 11pm. Still no sign of delivery. @Uber @Uber_Support @UberINSupport @UberEats @UberEats_IND #GreatExperience
2019-09-27 17:41:03+00:00,Where are my promo codes @Uber_Support i use uber everyday.
2019-09-27 07:27:05+00:00,"Perennial problem with these guys. I have now stopped revealing my destination when they call. Usually leads to the same conclusion though! Unless @Uber starts penalizing drivers for canceling like this, I am afraid we will continue to suffer at their hands. @Uber_Support "
2019-09-27 06:09:14+00:00,Excuse me @Uber_Support I ordered an Uber Pool but a car showed up?? I’m wearing floaties and now 3 strangers are laughing at me
2019-09-26 22:51:15+00:00,Not sure how he gets a 4.92 rating when he does not pick up! This driver Never picked us up but I am being charged a fee? @Uber @Uber_Support #BadService #DoBetter
2019-09-26 18:44:06+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support if the driver cancels we get a fee, if we cancel we get a fee. I have had several drivers cancel on me after THEY get lost or give up on the fair. Where is our compensation for their mess ups, for our time wasted? You seem to only value the driver's time."
2019-09-26 17:14:46+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support Terrible #MumbaiRains. Standing with #seniorcitizen.The guy calls. He's right outside. He asks if I'm going to Thane. He cancels! When I try rebooking immediately, you force cancellation charge. Refund process says Oh, Ambernath drove for so long!"
2019-09-26 15:10:32+00:00,We can confirm no driving occurred during or after this moment. #CLINCHED
2019-09-26 13:34:50+00:00,And @Uber_Support’s critical response line just hung up on me... Gonna go with final straw for this company
2019-09-26 12:54:12+00:00,WOW. Read this drivers story of having a gun put to his head and robbed while completing a ride. He has contacted #Uber 4 times regarding the incident and has still received NO answer! https://ride.guru/lounge/p/gun-put-to-my-head-with-uberpool-passengers-oakland #uberdriver @Uber_Support
2019-09-26 11:38:33+00:00,"Less than a week after @Uber_Support assured me (3rd time!!) that I’d never find Jump bikes blocking the Hatton Garden cycle path again, what do I find? Photos taken seconds after a @pedalmeapp bike was forced into pedestrians due to blocked lane. @MetCycleCops @london_cycling"
2019-09-26 09:45:09+00:00,"It is so shocking that inspite of lodging complaint in the app and forwarding my number on @Twitter, nobody from @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber has bothered to call and ask me about my problem. #Uber @PlanetPowai @powaiinfo @mypowai @AllPowai @mid_day"
2019-09-26 08:24:14+00:00,Really? What sort of training do you provide for your drivers? What do you do to ensure pickup and drop off points are safe and legal?
2019-09-26 07:38:46+00:00,Why is it that if I let an @Uber_Support drive to me for ten minutes then cancelled I'd get charged but drivers can keep you waiting for 10 minutes then cancel without a problem? Now I'm running late 
2019-09-26 05:47:39+00:00,"No, thanks"
2019-09-26 02:17:17+00:00,"I’m not filling out your form. I’m not an Uber Rider; I’m a pedestrian, bicyclist and public transit user that doesn’t appreciate your drivers endangering my safety. This is a systematic issue and your little form isn’t going to help."
2019-09-26 01:23:58+00:00,I have sent atleast five messages and raised the issue multiple times to @Uber_Support through app. But absolutely no response. I am usually a happy @Uber customer but such instances give you an indication of what lies ahead. 4/n
2019-09-25 23:47:41+00:00,"Well it wasn't you this today. It was you on Monday. But I guess I'll DM next time. I just wish it were an option in the app. Show all the full history of who accepted a ride, even if they cancel."
2019-09-25 22:31:44+00:00,"Congratulations @cta x @Uber_Support @AskLyft for ensuring everyone in Chicago’s commute this evening was either crowded, long, and/or extraordinarily expensive"
2019-09-25 18:52:24+00:00,"It’s been a week and still haven’t heard from @Uber_Support on a huge issue. What’s up with the poor customer service, @Uber?"
2019-09-25 12:57:21+00:00,"Reports from drivers around the country that @Uber @Uber_Support has not paid them. Supposedly the instant payment system is experiencing ""technical difficulties"". Money market trouble? @CNN @MSNBC @WSJ @markets @WIRED"
2019-09-25 10:23:35+00:00,"Been waiting for @UberEats @Uber_Support to deliver food for over an hour now. The latest delivery time said 12:10. But here we are. And it said someone was on their way to fetch it, then went back to ""preparing your order"". You guys are annoying. Cancel it. Pay me back."
2019-09-25 09:17:13+00:00,I am pissed and extremely disappointed with @Uber @Uber_Support I booked a car to head to the airport with a fare of 86 Euro...cool. When the ride was over @Uber added a surcharge. We were never alerted of the surcharge until the ride was over! We should know this before we book!
2019-09-25 07:51:50+00:00,Left my phone in a #real #blacktaxi on Saturday night on the way home. Realised when I got in. Called the phone. Driver returned with phone. Driver got a tip. Everyone’s happy. #deleteuber
2019-09-25 01:24:15+00:00,Damn right! Especially if THEY cancelled the ride it sounds like a scam! Why should the rider be charged for a cancelled ride.
2019-09-24 20:20:49+00:00,You'll be back in one soon enough 
2019-09-24 20:10:50+00:00,"After today’s diabolical @uber mess, and no resolution yet by @Uber_Support, as a very busy taxi user it is good to report that, due to a recent ability to cancel bookings on a whim, &amp; living with the flak, most uber drivers prefer to work with @kaptenuk @viavan_lon &amp; @boltapp"
2019-09-24 19:43:48+00:00,Just another reason I'll take a cab or public transportation before I ever set foot in an Uber. Way too many horror stories.
2019-09-24 19:19:57+00:00,"Very frustrated with @Uber and @Uber_Support. Got charged 2x for a ride from the airport &amp; they refuse to refund the duplicate charge, even when I sent a CC statement. Needless to say, it’s time to #deleteuber. I’m switching to @lyft. #badcustomerservice"
2019-09-24 19:19:36+00:00,Left my phone in an Uber on Friday. Spoke to the driver and was told it was not left in his car. Went to the address that ‘find my iphone’ tracked my phone too. Oh. Look at that. There’s the Uber drivers car What you gonna do about that? @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-09-24 19:05:25+00:00,"Wow @Uber_Support Uber driver said “the traffic was too heavy to make a living” so he cancelled journey mid-trip &amp; left me in the rain. Just seen he’s charged me a £45 cleaning fee - no evidence of this fictional mess, no discussion, you’ve just charged my card! Nice one"
2019-09-24 17:56:49+00:00,The most #PATHETIC &amp; #UNPROFESSIONAL attitude by @Uber @Uber_Support 3 cabs cancelled after booking at nick of the time and charged cancellation money from my account
2019-09-24 17:17:03+00:00,"Or, you could check your database of drivers, confirm this plate belongs to a driver, and end their ability to drive for you based on their failure to follow the law."
2019-09-24 09:27:59+00:00,Well hello @Uber_Support your driver hasn't moved an inch in the last 5 mins when he was supposed to rch the pick up point in 3 mins. He has called and asked for the drop location n is now not taking calls. But if I cancel I'll be charged. Pray tell me why am I being penalised?
2019-09-24 06:37:15+00:00,"Just been cancelled by two @Uber drivers and ended up running to the tube almost being late to an appt, can I not rely on uber in the rain? heading back to the book a minicab days @Uber_Support"
2019-09-24 06:32:42+00:00,Hello @Uber_Support its high time to uninstall your app
2019-09-24 06:30:38+00:00,@Uber_Support dear uber your driver denied duty and why the hell you are cuting money from my wallet. Your driver was a scoundrel
2019-09-24 01:23:56+00:00,"So I gave it a day, fuck @UberEats and @Uber_Support don’t use their apps anymore. I recommend favor, grubhub, Postmates. Literally anything else."
2019-09-24 00:08:28+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support , we expect a simple courtesy service from your drivers to help us load our luggage, these days they will see the passenger struggling but won’t make an effort to get out of the cab Your ads are so fake"

Any response, @Uber_Support ?? This driver of yours is a real danger "
2019-09-23 22:42:28+00:00,Make sure you go to the hospital even if you don’t feel like it was that bad so you can get more coin
2019-09-23 21:00:56+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support a week ago a driver slammed on the brakes and put the car in reverse on the interstate. This week a driver pretended I left something in his car so he could sexually harass me. Do I get a refund for that or no
2019-09-23 18:33:08+00:00,I need your help! Mobile phone forgotten at uber vehicle on the way to Seattle Airport. I'm back at home now but cannot access my account to see uber drivers' contact. Please help me @Uber_Support
2019-09-23 15:46:44+00:00,"@Uber_Support why do you think it’s okay for your drivers to accept rides and then when I get in the car tell me there’s a fee he doesn’t want to pay so will drop me a walking distance from where I need to be, sadly I’m disabled and can’t do that. Shocked, disgusting behaviour."
2019-09-23 13:28:02+00:00,This fucker kept bullying me to cancel my trip. Deal with it. @Uber @Uber_Support pic.twitter.com/ZWRjfechv7
2019-09-22 21:37:56+00:00,@Uber_Support what is the deal with your “wait time” fee??? We got charged .26 for a wait time??? We were standing outside and walked to the car when he pulled up....WTF??? Becoming just like everyone else nickel and diming your customers....I actually have a mobility disability
2019-09-22 21:00:06+00:00,this probably wouldn’t have happened if you did a tiktok to benjamin counter
2019-09-22 20:53:35+00:00,Shame on them. Boycott. Looks like their drivers aren’t vetted after all. I was reading through the threads hoping to see some type of action from them. Shame on them.
2019-09-22 20:33:49+00:00,@Uber_Support one of your stupid drivers has my wallet and tried to get me to Venmo him to give it back. Still don’t have it and he’s not answering me. I don’t think this is legal? What’s up with that.
2019-09-22 20:26:41+00:00,I'm so sorry you had to experience that sis ... thank God you are safe The truth is we are never 100% safe but @Uber 's service is muuch better You tweeted this 5hrs ago and still no word from @Boltapp_za @Uber_Support replies in less than 2minutes 
2019-09-22 19:05:35+00:00,Can you send proof you’ve reported it to police? Or will you hide it from them like before?
2019-09-22 18:13:52+00:00,Today my friend lost her wallet in a @Uber cab... There's no revert back through Uber chat support. We are also trying to contact uber's call support service since an hour but there's no response at all. Very disappointed by @Uber_Support services.
2019-09-22 17:33:39+00:00,@Uber_Support Dear Uber I tried to use your service in London today from Strand Palace Hotel to Kings X. Driver didn’t turn up. Called help line who couldn’t help. Charged £71 for trip I couldn’t take!! What’s going on?
2019-09-22 16:35:04+00:00,This is really absurd! I have been charged more than 300 rupees for just 3-4 kms travel in Delhi I have been charged Toll even though I travelled witin Delhi and didn't cross any toll! Ther is no option to talk to customer support complaint @Uber_Support @Uber @ConsumrConxion
2019-09-22 12:11:37+00:00,I want to thank @Uber_Support for helping me out with somebody else using my debit card and racking up charges. Hopefully they get what they deserve. It'll catch up to them eventually
2019-09-22 07:25:00+00:00,"very pathetic service from @Uber_Support @Uber_India in the past 15 minutes, my ride has been cancelled 5 times. why does not @Uber take any action against these drivers? and you call yourself as a premier company!!!!"
2019-09-21 22:08:50+00:00,@Uber_Support I have just been charged £5.79 to my bank yesterday for an Uber I did not get?? Can u help please I don’t use Uber lol
2019-09-21 21:26:45+00:00,I am astounded by the inability of @Uber_Support to resolve even basic issues of user experience and functionality.
2019-09-21 20:43:09+00:00,@Uber_Support being charged for a driver cancelling on me because he didn’t know where he was going! absolutely ridiculous when I’m stood waiting with children !!! He even phoned for instruction and I told him how to get to me! Rude!
2019-09-21 20:27:40+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support why is continuing without seeing your fare even an option? Which episode of Black Mirror is this?

2019-09-20 12:53:10+00:00,"Apparently @Uber thinks illegal, discriminatory refusal of service to a disabled person should be described as: “not the Uber experience you expected.” What a joke, @Uber_Support. Do better. Fix it. "
2019-09-20 09:51:13+00:00,I’ve had this happen to me and had Uber deal with those issues in a way that over all I’ve been quite happy with. This response is frankly inadequate. “Not the Uber experience you expected”??? No- you’re sorry the driver broke the law and you should say so.
2019-09-20 06:47:12+00:00,So @Uber @Uber_Support People with disabilities are refused rides with you. I can’t even attempt to get a ride in Adelaide because you have no wheelchair accessible vehicles You won’t give me a date when they will be available either. I need to contact @AusHumanRights

2019-09-18 11:30:29+00:00,"Funny how people think they pay what they see on the screen.. riders need to wake up that the fares are estimate and once in, fare could change. Its in the small print. @UberUK uses cheap quote to bait riders than they hike it up.."

2019-09-17 07:33:28+00:00,Wtf @Uber_Support @UberINSupport @Uber . What audacity is this. And what confidence to deny a ride and not being scared of the possible causes. And over it I am charged cancellation fee. I WANR HIM FIRED FOR HIS FUCKERY. Who hires such chutiya people? pic.twitter.com/uUVRjsbmfo
2019-09-17 06:16:21+00:00,Dear Uber. There is a groundswell of feeling and communication around these failings. I believe there is a solution which I would like to discuss which could address these issues.
2019-09-16 23:38:17+00:00,"So @Uber_Support doesn't value customers, they only send automated responses... Customer service is a 0/10, wasted a lot of money to be almost 10 mins EARLY to my internship this morning and by the time my uber got me there I was 15 mins late because their ETA time was incorrect."
2019-09-16 16:59:29+00:00,"So it has been 3 WEEKS and no one from @Uber_Support has told me what actually caused my account to be disabled, nor has it been fixed. I've been reassured that follow-ups are happening, but still no explanation. @Uber who do I need to escalate this to?"
2019-09-16 16:54:10+00:00,It’s been two weeks and a day. @Uber_Support @Uber Where is my money?
2019-09-16 15:31:35+00:00,Okay @Uber_Support what's going on with your service?? I've had promote for four separate drivers in the last six minutes that I've been waiting.. Why are you randomly changing my cab?? And Where is the damn cab?
2019-09-16 14:45:58+00:00,"@Uber_Support hi, I left a bag in a car last night. I do not speak his language but the hotel managed to speak to him and he acknowledged the bag was there. He then hung up and won’t respond. He’s basically stolen the belongings. I can’t contact him as I don’t speak the language!"
2019-09-16 13:12:07+00:00,"Shameful, atrocious. This seems to be the attitude of 80% of the Uber/Ola drivers I've come across in Chennai. They seem to think that Uber is their employee (one guy told me this verbatim). @UberINSupport needs to address ASAP!"
2019-09-16 13:11:23+00:00,What aragonce he made? He using words with respect. If vehicle gets delay she should cancel that taxi then choose for another one. If not both she would get an auto but she didn't either. For saving money she still wait for that taxi and fight with him
2019-09-16 12:44:28+00:00,"Helo @UberINSupport @Uber_Support @Uber What ridiculous it is, when I didn't even canceled the trip, it asked me for ₹20 to pay to Uber. Kindly refund my money. SS attached."
2019-09-16 11:39:46+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support/@Uber - someone signed up as a driver with my email address. I told you this in 2017 but you haven't done anything. I can't use your support site because I don't actually have a login. How do I stop receiving emails with someone else's personal information in?
2019-09-16 11:33:05+00:00,Omg she's trembling. Is she ok? 
2019-09-16 10:57:50+00:00,Worst ever and u can generalise this as many drivers are doing like this!
2019-09-16 10:12:45+00:00,@Uber_Support hello.... I got charged for a trip that the driver cancelled ... How is that possible ?
2019-09-16 06:41:04+00:00,Disappointed with #Uber.. driver asks me to cancel and I refuse. So he comes to my place and cancels saying I didn’t show up.. and I have been charged with a cancellation fee..

2019-09-15 20:59:21+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_ES I was charged twice as much just because the driver didn’t know the map

2019-09-15 12:02:43+00:00,Why should I bear the cancellation charges when your driver starts the trip without coming to the pickup location??? Am I supposed to wait till he reached my destination alone?? @Uber_Mumbai @Uber_Support
2019-09-15 11:08:14+00:00,Just tweet a brief apology in the middle of the night when no-one will notice it. Sort of thing his employers excel at

2019-09-14 00:00:10+00:00,FYI I used to drive for Uber. Background checks weren’t very thorough (although I’ve been through several FBI checks for security). So I saw some of the other drivers and understand your concern.
2019-09-13 23:58:52+00:00,Sounds like that worked just like gun Control. It doesn’t. Good luck. Friday the 13th.
2019-09-13 23:58:12+00:00,That is exactly why UBER and LYFT and the other ride sharing guys should have to have CDL licenses like Limo drivers for drug testing. It's bad enough they are on the road but acting like commercial taxi's without consequence is BS.
2019-09-13 23:57:29+00:00,What???? Come on people.... it’s legal but not to drive while doing it. @Uber let’s get this handled fairly quickly please.

2019-09-12 23:11:10+00:00,This guy. I told him nicely that parking in the bike lane was so dangerous to bikers during rush hour (all the time) and he yelled at me- “but I’m an Uber.” @Uber @Uber_Support Please let your drivers know this is so not cool (and illegal). @311DCgov 11 and C St SE

2019-09-07 12:05:15+00:00,"They won’t go to the trouble of making a police report. They’ll leave that to her because that’s how they do. They also won’t do anything to the guy except MAYBE can him for it. And then what’s to stop him from just doing Lyft or Postmates, unless SHE pursues charges."
2019-09-07 11:56:14+00:00,"@Uber_Support you don't take things like this seriously. I had a scary, unsafe driver in LA, I reported it FROM his car as he was refusing to pull over and let me out and nobody would even contact me back. You only take it seriously when it's made public"
2019-09-07 11:46:47+00:00,"Corporate media accounts always post publicly about what ""they take very srsly"". You know the passenger's name and location. Uber needs to investigate this and contact the police about the predator they contract. Simple. Do NOT put the onus on victims. Do better."

2019-09-05 22:38:43+00:00,"Remember when y'all added a ""safe rides fee,"" creating a false sense of security, but then you just pocketed the $500 million as extra revenue and didn't actually improve safety? Good times!"

2019-08-20 05:55:29+00:00,.@Uber_Support I urge you to communicate the importance of maintaining basic hygiene and cleanliness to drivers. The cab I sat in today was so filthy that I'm certain I'm going to end up falling sick. @Uber_India
2019-08-20 01:08:38+00:00,This is directly related to driver earnings...Uber & Lyft charge riders outlandish prices and have been keeping the majority of it. This is no joke & lives are at stake...as you can attest. Please use your popularity to raise awareness of this issue. Thanks
2019-08-20 00:49:45+00:00,"Serious, non-sarcastic question for @Uber_Support: in your driver background check, do you look for how many speeding tickets a driver has? If a driver has 9 speeding tickets in under a year (including 8 in a six month span) is that disqualifying? "

2019-08-18 05:09:04+00:00,.@Uber_Support my ubereats order has changed drivers 6 times and the estimated delivery time has been delayed over an hour. I’ll be jumping ship to grub hub if this continues.
2019-08-18 04:12:45+00:00,I've got a better idea @Uber_Support How about everyone in the department downloads the Rockpile Report podcast this week if they want a closer look. The podcast will be released Wednesday night.

Also give us back 80 cents a mile we were getting before you cut us to 60 cents for no good reason @Uber_Support
2019-08-18 02:33:23+00:00,"Key word “DEAF” your support page just sends me to leaving a voicemail or calling which again, my deaf friend is physically incapable of doing. This is clearly discrimination."

2019-08-11 07:37:46+00:00,@Uber_Support .. Uber help. My friend disappeared after ordering an Uber from JHB Maboneng Saturday morning (+_1:30am) @tumisole @SundayTimesZA @Julius_S_Malema @MYANC
2019-08-11 02:00:01+00:00,"I’d assume Uber was contacted first, no? They could’ve pin pointed the driver"
2019-08-11 00:46:02+00:00,"but months ago you denied his request, uber ???? https://twitter.com/IonDiablo/status/1160211831232720896?s=20"
2019-08-10 23:11:18+00:00,No he called them before and they said they refuse to share anything
2019-08-10 22:18:57+00:00,Flexin ass uber only wanna help whe theres a audience
2019-08-10 21:32:59+00:00,"Taz, Uber are obliged to provide you with an accurate fare estimate, as it is a condition of their license. Complain to @TfLTPH who regulate Uber in London because I'm afraid you'll get nowhere with Uber."
2019-08-10 20:42:43+00:00,Okay but then why are your representatives saying they don’t wanna help.... worms for brains
2019-08-10 19:39:16+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support yall need to help this man find his LITTLE sister, &amp; she went missing after using YALL app that's ridiculous and inhumane"
2019-08-10 13:34:47+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber how your drivers accept ride then refuse to cancel when they are clearly the one who doesn't wanna go is bad. I cant keep paying 400 everytime. I wont pay this btw
2019-08-10 11:39:48+00:00,Your drivers suck @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_RSA. They drive around in circles and then refuse to cancel the trip so that I can cancel and they’ll get the free cancellation fee??
2019-08-10 07:08:11+00:00,"Early morning run through Islington, pavements are blocked with dockless bikes blown over in the storm. I’ve counted 5! How is a disabled, mobility impaired or buggy user supposed to navigate this? @Uber_Support @limebikeuk"
2019-08-10 07:00:11+00:00,No like i take it back this double cheeseburger has me wishingggg i ordered it in the first place
2019-08-10 06:06:11+00:00,"That's what happens when you stop using the good old British taxis or even a local cab, You went for the cheap option it certainly wasn't cheap."
2019-08-10 05:12:59+00:00,"The local Taxi company still existed , your lucky. Uber have wiped many of them out. If only more people supported their local businesses, instead of using inferior shoddy unregulated tax avoiding American crap."
2019-08-10 05:10:21+00:00,Uber driver watches YouTube while driving and @Uber_Support remain unresponsive for the complaint. He drives rash and abusive to other people in traffic. All this around midnight with a single lady passenger that too in Uber Premium... @Uber @ndtv @MirrorNow @fayedsouza
2019-08-09 23:20:34+00:00,"Rich, I’d suggest you go straight to your local police station and report the theft, as that’s what it is. Especially since you say that you’ve got proof. Get the police, and your bank, involved. It’s the only way this will ever stop."
2019-08-09 23:19:21+00:00,"3 drivers cancelled on me leaving me stood in the rain for 40 minutes. I finally call a local taxi company and cancel the 4th confirmed Uber. I'm charged £6 for ""the drivers time"". What about my time for the 3 that cancelled on me? #Uber @Uber @Uber_Support"
2019-08-09 22:57:50+00:00,Any one that uses Uber gets what they deserve.
2019-08-09 20:42:33+00:00,"I won’t retweet because you never cared about the taxi drivers & transport providers that lost more than your £600 since Uber started operating, sorry."
2019-08-09 20:30:28+00:00,Thanks for the advice. I'll be getting in touch with the council they're registered to.
2019-08-09 15:35:12+00:00,Ffs... contact your card company and initiate a refund for illegal transaction
2019-08-09 14:05:54+00:00,Speak to whomever regulates and gives uber permission to operate in your area.
2019-08-09 12:43:02+00:00,"I'm absolutely appalled by @Uber and @Uber_Support My fiance @BicRicko has been charged £600 for an uber he can prove he was never in. They are doing the bare minimum to resolve this. We have a wedding to pay for, sort your customer service out!!!!!! PLZ RETWEET!!!! "
2019-08-09 10:44:31+00:00,#uber take absolutely nothing seriously. You're just a bot that tries to pacify people and get them to direct message you so nothing bad is seen in public. Do not DM uber let the world know how bad they treat both passenger and driver.
2019-08-09 08:55:21+00:00,Getting paid $5 to drive an empty car where I want to go sounds like a good deal
2019-08-09 05:33:59+00:00,When serious situation comes up they won't see you. Who called you into this matter now 
2019-08-09 05:06:34+00:00,idea for you: treat ur driver like a human F’ing being & just tell them what u would prefer. Maybe hand them a couple $$cash as gratitude for the service customization. Humans dont like being told to shut up or perform like a circus animal cuz the cargo clicked a button
2019-08-09 04:24:09+00:00,"Just as these Uber and Ola guys incentivise drivers for completing a minimum number of trips, they should start PENALIZING drivers if they cancel more than 1 trip in 10. The problem will vanish!"
2019-08-09 02:26:11+00:00,I took an @Uber and there were ants and spiders crawling all over me and my family and @Uber_Support thinks a $5 credit is enough and won’t give me my money back. Here’s a video of some of the spiders. 
2019-08-08 23:04:12+00:00,So you can track down the driver and destroy a struggling man. very clever.
2019-08-08 22:20:35+00:00,"Uber, you were not tagged to the original post for a reason. Dey your lane."
2019-08-08 20:43:36+00:00,She didn't ask you. Bebelube 
2019-08-08 17:41:04+00:00,"Oga, she’s not complaining. Calm down."
2019-08-08 16:56:54+00:00,"Y’all be doing the most Nigerians, who tagged @Uber_Support now. Y’all just be snitching anyhow in this country . @Uber_Support don’t mind them jare"
2019-08-08 16:55:36+00:00,"Hey, @Uber_India, thanks for reminding me why I stopped using your services. This evening, I made a booking, driver accepts, I wait 10 mins and then he cancels mins before arrival. Then, nothing’s available. Got down, hailed a rickshaw. Much simpler. @Uber_Support @Uber"
2019-08-08 16:29:26+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support I sent an Uber to pick somebody up and they cancelled the ride for no reason; sent another uber and they also cancelled for no reason. The charges are still pending on my card, I need some redress ASAP"
2019-08-08 13:11:09+00:00,So Last night some dusty uber driver thought he was slick adjusting a uber ride from two days ago. Mind you the ride wasn’t even a mile. @Uber @Uber_Support I’m Really not jokin around with you. Shit is really crazy. pic.twitter.com/5wwVuuSv34
2019-08-08 10:04:14+00:00,"I was a victim of the vomit fraud in Uber, they charged me 70€ for a supposed ""vomit"" during a 5 min ride. This is the photo that @Uber_Support used to accuse me.

2019-08-08 09:00:33+00:00,@UberNigeria i have just been ripped off by one of your drivers. A ride that's meant to be est N1200 from oniru to VI was charged N2150 for it. The trip route showed movement inwards lekki which never happened. I need a refund. @Gidi_Traffic @trafficbutter @Uber @Uber_Support 
2019-08-08 05:55:46+00:00,Today morning I booked an auto and the driver started the trip without me and after sometime he cancelled the http://trip.Now Uber is asking me to pay rupees 162.Why should I pay 162 ? I'm a regular customer of uber.But it was a horrible experience for me.@Uber_Support
2019-08-08 04:31:32+00:00,State of this customer service from @Uber @Uber_Support - Driver goes wrong way multiple times during the trip - Nearly crashes when trying to make late turn - Nearly crashes on freeway - Confused with navigation and goes back to one of stops he already went too 
2019-08-08 03:11:50+00:00," Nah, y’all gave me $5 after your driver put my life at risk. Keep your cookout tray, I already deleted the app"
2019-08-07 22:04:47+00:00,"There’s no way my @Uber driver has her license, this is unacceptable @Uber_Support "
2019-08-07 21:21:01+00:00,Listen @Uber @Uber_Support don’t start y’all bullshit cause of a little rain. Ain’t nobody trying to pay $60 to go anywhere. #NYC
2019-08-07 21:11:00+00:00,Oh no! These things happen. Please send us a DM with your email address and our team will follow up.
2019-08-07 17:20:16+00:00,"will do. with regards to you taking this seriously, it is clearly not true. i see literally thousands of your drivers blocking and dropping passengers in bike lanes in san francisco every week."
2019-08-07 17:13:31+00:00,How about some follow up on your actions?
2019-08-07 16:28:00+00:00,This @Grubhub driver was illegally in the Milwaukee bike lane outside Perilla last night. She also drives for @Uber_Support. She was rude and clearly did not care that she was violating the law and endangering people. @bikelaneuprise #bikechi
2019-08-07 10:52:49+00:00,"Hi @Uber_Support. 11.50 was removed from my account for 2 journeys despite me not starting either, let alone completing them. You’ve since offered me 8 quid credit. This isn’t good enough. We’ve been back and forth for 2 days. Refund me the full amount, not credit. Thanks"
2019-08-07 08:47:35+00:00,"Thanks, but I’ve already done this. Now I’m about to walk from a dodgy train station in the pitch dark because I eventually had to give up on my Uber. I’m not worried about the fee, I’m worried about safety. What are you doing to stop this behaviour?"
2019-08-07 08:23:56+00:00,"After all this wahala I'm going through, @Uber_Support @uber I truly hope you guys will refund me. I really don't like trouble. So I just hope you refund me. I don't know what's happening... how won't your driver be able to login and end my trip? Just how? @Uber_Support @Uber"
2019-08-07 07:39:40+00:00,AND I still have to pay a cancellation fee plus order a new car?! This is awful and also unsafe as it is very early in the morning! What are you going to do about this @Uber_Support
2019-08-07 06:58:13+00:00,Make restitution for the assault and stolen case then. Tick tick - London license.
2019-08-07 06:56:23+00:00,Do we only take action on men's indecent intentions after it's beyond repair or control for a woman? @Uber_Support @Uber_India @jaipur_police I was taken to a secluded location at midnight 10kms away from my destination. No Action Yet!! What are you doing for my safety?
2019-08-07 03:38:24+00:00,Done! I think I need to order some food via @UberEats to celebrate.
2019-08-06 22:10:19+00:00,"@Uber_Support hello i recently got in an uber and was told to “get out of the car fatty, you’re going to set my airbags off”, he then spat on me and threw me out on the M18. i managed to get a picture of the driver, this was him please all i want is justice "
2019-08-06 20:23:56+00:00,.@Uber_Support Is there any way to ensure you don't suspend my account for using a VPN on my phone during DEFCON this year?
2019-08-06 20:22:30+00:00,@Uber_Support your customer service is atrocious! I've been charged £606 for a journey I didn't take and I'm having to wait up to 24hrs between responses on your instant messenger. How can you have a customer services department but no direct line for the escalation team! Awful!
2019-08-06 19:40:13+00:00,"@Uber_Support Hey, @dkhos, so deactivating #paxhole accounts was yet another Uber lie."
2019-08-06 19:36:21+00:00,Your drivers should know it is a human rights violation to refuse a ride to a person with a service animal. It is not incumbent upon the person using the service animal to work with your people. It is your companies responsibility not to discriminate against #PWD
2019-08-06 17:50:45+00:00,I was denied a ride yesterday by @Uber because I have a #serviceanimal. @Uber_Support feels that giving me a free ride good enough compensation for making me late for a very important meeting. Maybe @Uber_CONN thinks #disabled people have nothing important to go to. I disagree.
2019-08-06 05:45:05+00:00,"WE DID IT FAM..... but new problem, he hasn’t closed it out on his app so it says the delivery is still pending which means I can’t tip him?? @Uber_Support *NOW* can you actually help?? "
2019-08-06 05:15:23+00:00,"@Uber_Support can I somehow cancel to free this man from his suffering while still getting him paid... is that.... a thing. I don’t even want my food or a refund lol JUST LET THIS POOR MAN GO HOME, the app isn’t even open anymore for delivery"
2019-08-05 20:39:05+00:00,"Wait, so you are going to reply to this (not saying it should've been ignored), but not address @DuncanCantDie and the problem he has had TWICE in a row? K @Uber @Uber_Support , I see you."
2019-08-05 18:40:40+00:00,"Im actually so mad. To them im just 1 person, so they dont care if they lose 1 customer when they have millions more.

2019-08-05 18:24:54+00:00,#Beware of Momen Khan in #Leicester #Uber driver charging £80 for something we didn’t do and taking 12hours to do it it’s a joke @Uber @Uber_Support offered no help or support - the fact these drivers can take money out of your account With no proof is #theft in my eyes
2019-08-05 18:16:12+00:00,AVOID using @Uber @Uber_Support I always thought it was great but it’s a complete scam charging £80 for a £7 journey it’s disgusting! https://twitter.com/brano1979/status/1158439370539581441
2019-08-05 14:15:43+00:00,Ordered coffee & a sandwich & the Uber driver spills all the coffee on my sandwich.He goes back to get the order again & comes back with no sandwich and just shrugs. All I wanted was a damn sandwich. You dont want a pissed off hungry girl @work on a Monday morning @Uber_Support
2019-08-05 09:38:43+00:00,"It's because you use them so much, that they do it. They're expected to announce losses of $4.9 BILLION - not million - for the last quarter. Now they're a private company the only people who are going to pay it, is the customer. Until recently, they charged 41% of the fare."
2019-08-05 09:03:36+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support wanted to say your driver partner returned my airpods which i left them absent mindedly in the car today. Thanks.
2019-08-05 05:01:26+00:00,Dear .@Uber_Support .@Uber I just paid Rs320 cash to your driver for a trip I just took and he’s reporting it as not paid...pls tell me you are not also hiring thieves as drivers as well now #Uber #UberFail
2019-08-05 01:13:41+00:00,@Uber @UberUKsupport @UberUK @Uber_Support Please can you contact the driver with number plate EX130XJ as he parks in a loading bay every single night (it’s currently 2am) in a residential area playing music loudly with the windows open. This is not acceptable. (Leeds area) 
2019-08-04 22:13:43+00:00,Somehow almost forgot that our @Uber crashed into another Uber on our way to the venue yesterday in Portimao. We just got out and walked the final few yards. @Uber_Support who do we speak to about this?
2019-08-04 21:41:26+00:00,Day 14 @Uber took money from my @PayPal account. Money that I did not own to Uber. @Uber_Support Denied it and said I was confuesed. I´m going to tweet ever single Day till @Uber takes responsibility. What you ´ve done is not Legal @Uber .
2019-08-04 21:35:55+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, how about a way to report drivers who cancel on you? I just had a driver ow down to pick me up then speed off when he saw I had luggage. There's currently no way to report drivers who make the service worse in ways like that."
2019-08-04 19:44:38+00:00,Pathetic situation of #Uber service in india. @Uber @Uber_Support @UberINSupport @PMOIndia #IfanyGovtorConcernedPersonCares
2019-08-04 18:10:22+00:00,JUST WAITED AN HOUR FOR @UberEats @Uber_Support AND THEN WAS TOLD IT WAS CANCELLED WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY ON THE WAY FOR THE PAST 20 MINS LOL K DELETING YOUR TRASH APP NOW AND USING LYFT FOR RIDES THANKS
2019-08-04 17:19:31+00:00,"You guys really need to train your drivers & give license to the ones who are deserving. They cancel cabs so many times, their tone of language isn’t right. Definitely this incident is ridiculous, think about the girl’s safety! @Uber @Uber_Support"
2019-08-04 16:58:31+00:00,"You’ll be back for more. Uber users always return, despite the surge pricing, account hacking, Vomit scams and unchecked drivers. Not even cheaper than black cabs anymore either."
2019-08-04 14:19:17+00:00,So @Uber @Uber_Support charged me nearly £50 for a £24 journey. Absolutely disgusted. Between me and my friend we took 8 ubers in 24hrs and still charges like that. Frankly I'm done with you guys now.
2019-08-04 12:10:44+00:00,My Uber driver just called Sam Smith the male Mariah Carey. What are you gonna do about this?? @Uber_Support
2019-08-04 11:26:35+00:00,A. Uber drivers are not employees. They're independent contractors. B. You're phone was not stolen. You left it behind and are now trying to excuse your irresponsible behavior by accusing your driver of theft. C. You agree to when creating your Uber account
2019-08-04 08:02:13+00:00,This is so messed up for some reason this story really scared me. Imagine the safety button on the app directs your call to the driver? @Uber_Support @Uber figure this out.
2019-08-04 07:35:52+00:00,I won't stoop to his level. Where I'm from snitches get stitches.
2019-08-04 07:33:02+00:00,"I'm a regular user of Uber / Ola, so is my daughter @AranyaJohar and her friends, it is terrifying to imagine anyone in this space @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Olacabs Make it safe for us to use your facilities with any fears"
2019-08-04 06:46:25+00:00,"Oh great . You have a safety team! What the fuck was this team doing when the lady needed help!? This situation could easily have taken a turn for the worse. Get your act together. @Uber_Support @Uber_India @Uber and @Olacabs, also take note."

2019-08-04 05:19:51+00:00,Sent chills down my http://spine.How @Uber_Support failed a woman who pressed the 'safety' button on the app when faced with a threatening driver. The call went to the driver instead!! How is that a safety measure for the customer moreso for a woman? @SheThePeople
2019-08-04 04:38:24+00:00,"Same here! Im visually impaired. They end up on my property, they litter our city. People are irresponsible. And the businesses making them are irresponsible. @ScooterLime @BirdScooters1 @erazorscooters @Uber @lyft @AskLyft @Uber_Support "
2019-08-04 01:37:57+00:00,I got it I had trouble in the past but one driver quit and another had to be used tonight so it took longer
2019-08-03 20:48:05+00:00,"My phone was turned off yet somehow @Uber_Support charged me $12.79 PLUS a $5 cancellation fee for a ride I never ordered. (And since my phone was off with a dead battery, I could not have ordered one even if I had wanted to!) They have no customer svc number. Gee, thanks."
2019-08-03 20:01:24+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support! Looks like someone stole my debit card info and has racked up over $300 in fraudulent charges on your app
2019-08-03 19:11:55+00:00,"Exactly!This idiot called Uber,who in turn connected him with the driver. @Uber_Support should contact the driver and let him know that this idiot &amp; his pathetic wife are directly accusing him of theft on socia media,publishing his picture and everything.He has the right to know."
2019-08-03 18:46:32+00:00,Here’s a clue. Your glasses are at the hub. Go to the hub and get your glasses. End of story. Stop being a crybaby and pretending they’re stolen when the fact is you left them in the Uber. You did not call the Driver directly because once your ride is over that connection ends.
2019-08-03 17:52:44+00:00,@Uber_India @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_BLR @Uber_ES @Uber_Brasil solve this issue immediately and refund my amount. Idiotic driver you people have
2019-08-03 10:56:52+00:00,Kate nothing personal but self employed taxi drivers & licensed mini cab services have suffered whilst the world stares at their phones. At what point did you realise your phone wasn’t the thing getting you home? It was either enslaved drivers on tax credits or a legal service.
2019-08-03 10:43:35+00:00,Hey @Uber your service is simply shit in every city of Pakistan. Booked a cab since 20 mins and it is showing 5 mins since last 20 mins. Called the driver and found him as stupid as most of your Cheaptons. How many time will I get dolled more? @Uber_Support pic.twitter.com/FAM8AW2nha
2019-08-03 09:51:28+00:00,"Being good to people doesn't cost much! @Uber_India @Uber_Support I have booked this Uber. Driver calls me up and rudely says Cancel the Uber, due to rains he won't come.. On saying he can cancel, he hung up saying ""TOH PHIR WAIT KARO"" "
2019-08-03 07:00:19+00:00,Contact @Uber_Support because that's completely unacceptable behavior from their drivers and very predatory.
2019-08-03 00:05:13+00:00,Can’t believe how appalling @Uber are. encouraging everyone to use alternatives instead. @Uber_Support
2019-08-02 23:18:02+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support I have 4 x cancelled trips that I did not cancel the driver did within 1 minute of accepting the jobs 2 on my account and 2 on my partners account I need refunding and these drivers are frauds NOW!
2019-08-02 16:19:34+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber it is very sad to see such customer response from uber. Even charging wrongly nd not refunding too
2019-08-02 10:27:18+00:00,Fortunately having worked in media for a long time it only takes 15mins to put together a decent media release. @Uber_Support &amp; @Uber you’re next.

2019-08-01 15:39:21+00:00,Peter detected a problem and eliminated the problem. NEXT!
2019-08-01 15:07:57+00:00,"Uber drivers often call and ask “whether card or cash” and cancel the trip when it’s card. It pisses me off but during random conversation with an @Uber_SL Today, he told “Uber takes more than a week to transfer their money” that seems to be a huge burden on them. @Uber_Support"
2019-08-01 13:40:59+00:00,"Yes, you are correct...nobody cares! Don't use #Uber or #Lyft call a cab!"
2019-08-01 13:37:32+00:00,"@Uber_Support @Uber_NYC (1/1) I took an uber pool to work this morning and upon arriving at my destination, I got out of the uber then reached back in to remove some trash from the backseat. my driver didn’t notice this and proceeded to drive forward and run over my foot."
2019-08-01 12:41:14+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support I have been stranded at a location for one hour because your drivers keep cancelling. Apparently they don't like my address. @Uber
2019-08-01 11:09:42+00:00,@Uber_Support @UberEats kindly advise where the rest of the burger is. The rest of the big mac?
2019-08-01 08:45:34+00:00,Same text same situation...same result .... Gali gali me shor hai Uber Eats Chor hai Chor hai... #BoycottUberEats @Uber @UberEats_IND @Uber_Support 
2019-08-01 06:44:23+00:00,"Had to wait 30 mins for @Uber_Kolkata @Uber_Support from #Kolkata airport to Spacetown - a ten min ride! While booking the wait time was11 mins. Cannot cancel without penalty when waiting time increases. In the time I waited, I could have done the trip thrice!"
2019-08-01 05:27:53+00:00,"#TheUberStory (2019) by @SeanNic, a documentary feature on the journey of @Uber, now streaming on @NetflixIndia. @Uber_India @Uber_Support @UberINSupport"
2019-08-01 01:56:16+00:00,.@Uber_Support this is my uber driver. she showed up in a nightgown and then offered me a water bottle filled with rat poison and told me she knew someone who would “snatch my teeth.” pls advise. i feel unsafe and also gay? 
2019-08-01 00:54:07+00:00,"@ZomatoIN @zomatocare @UberEats_IND then what is halal meat, why not jhatka meat . @Uber @Uber_Support what action u took against the driver who said get out to lady passenger having Hanuman sticker on phone. #boycottzomato #BoycottUberEats #boycottUber"
2019-07-31 21:37:28+00:00,When will @Uber_Support stop giving you the same driver you already cancelled 2x? I cancelled because they took four wrong turns and ended up stuck in traffic. I don’t want them again.
2019-07-31 21:07:25+00:00,"Thanks @Uber driver kicked me out of his car and refused my destination in the rain after I told him I was recovering from surgery because it was rush hour. And now I have to pay more and it is taking me an extra 40 min to get home, I feel super sick + nobody cares @Uber_Support "
2019-07-31 18:57:59+00:00,"Someone tweets a photo of an @uber crash with the license plate clearly visible. @Uber_support says ""please DM us with your contact info"". Does @uber not have the technology to track all of its drivers &amp; do a search by license plate?"
2019-07-31 17:47:47+00:00,"@Uber_Support hello, i want my 3$cancellation fee back "
2019-07-31 17:30:43+00:00,"When your business model is contingent on breaking laws, and you are losing billions of dollars monthly, the scam eventually comes to an end. Things are about to change in your gig-economy world."

2019-07-31 11:59:06+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support i had lost my debit card on friday in one of your partner driver’s car and he returned it today! His name is Sandeep! Wanted to say thank you! Also thanks @swarajdhanjal to get it back from him :-) #gratitude
2019-07-31 11:55:48+00:00,Ordered @Uber_India at 5. The app said that the cab will arrive in 12 minutes. It is now 25 minutes since and no sign of the cab! @Uber_Support
2019-07-31 06:59:39+00:00,Uber loses $1bn per quarter subsidising cheap fares to kill competition to dominate & then hike fares. The drivers are sub min wage supported by welfare whilst Uber avoid tax collecting rev to NL. Local cab companies/taxis struggling against this behemoth’s predatory pricing.
2019-07-31 05:30:50+00:00,Day 10 @Uber took money from my @PayPal account. Money that I did not own to Uber. @Uber_Support Denied it and said I was confuesed. I´m going to tweet ever single Day till @Uber takes responsibility. What you ´ve done is not Legal @Uber .
2019-07-31 03:46:38+00:00,Two part problem w rideshare drivers - they are thrust into complex urban driving situations hours on end w zero training beyond their A to B driving knowledge & the turnover is huge w a constant stream of new naive entrants. The companies aren’t equipped or inclined to fix it.
2019-07-31 02:46:10+00:00,Am I the only one that just noticed this week that our cut of the @Uber @Uber_Support cancellation fee went from $3.75 to $3.60. Passenger still charged $5.
2019-07-31 01:17:09+00:00,What does ur husband working for uber gtta do with no ac and if she wants to do a bad review 
2019-07-31 00:49:00+00:00,"If you’re a bad employment you deserve to face discipline, up to and including termination. If Farrah was uncomfortable, she has every single right to report it. The driver needs to be better."
2019-07-30 23:34:49+00:00,"Yes, you can give him 1 star and I hope you get a refund, glad you are ok, but my tweet specifically was because Uber owners desactivate the driver account and the person can't work until Uber activate it again"
2019-07-30 23:29:50+00:00,"The ride was, on so many levels, truly uncomfortable. I made this funny tweet or whatever but I didn’t go into full depth of what I experienced and if they’ll refund me for my hour long ride from hell then that’s pretty fierce If you ask me "
2019-07-30 23:14:32+00:00,"While the payment system is a problem, that’a another discussion. It’s the responsibility of the driver to make sure their passengers are comfortable, and this driver was not doing that. It’s part of the job"
2019-07-30 22:47:43+00:00,"Dont do it farrah. He is just an employe. My husband works for uber in nyc, they get only get a third part of what they make"
2019-07-30 22:08:43+00:00,Oh snap ! Haha ok will do
2019-07-30 13:05:34+00:00,I love your app but this isn’t okay @Uber_Support hey I was just charged $200 for a cleaning fee in a ride where I didn’t even spill a drink let alone anything with body fluid!! Please help Also it automatically deducted on an account and I received an overdraft fee.
2019-07-30 08:28:19+00:00,"This is the third time in a row that @Uber_Support has done this to me. Quotes me a price and then charges me a higher price at the end of the journey. No traffic, no waiting, no cause for delay. Standard route. Why? This is dishonest. @Uber"
2019-07-30 07:44:05+00:00,Uber drivers have this new trend of driving to places of their 'choice'. They even have the audacity of saying 'no' to the customer's destination once the ride is on! @Uber_Support @Uber_India are you taking notes?
2019-07-30 01:17:30+00:00,"Yes it’s Uber’s money-making racket since Day1. You use Uber you literally signed up to get screwed. Read the Uber user TermsOS-it clearly says they’re not responsible and they DGAF. You want a ‘cheap’ ride, that’s what you get."
2019-07-30 00:55:30+00:00,"This is concerning, @lexagriffinns. Please provide your phone number through which the trip was requested via DM, and we shall have this addressed at the earliest."
2019-07-29 14:15:58+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber shabby support system. Yesterday my friend’s husband missed his “wallet” last night in cab. Now they have been approaching to connect driver but he been non-respondent since long. Can you get them their wallet back.
2019-07-29 08:27:21+00:00,"Does @Uber_Support let drivers gouge tourists? Our driver went around in a circle, more than doubling our price and wasting an hour. As a user of @Uber in many countries I am surprised. 108 when it should have been 40?"
2019-07-29 04:33:25+00:00,What's the point of giving me coupon codes when your app won't accept them? Horrible scam. @Uber @Uber_Support @UberINSupport
2019-07-29 03:45:14+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support @uber and @AskLyft @lyft A lot of people cannot get to their cars behind police lines, how about comping some free rides to get people home?"
2019-07-29 03:08:16+00:00,"Uber driver made Val pay him cash to get his phone back, plus forced us to give him 5 stars and tip on the app, oh and Uber charged me $15 for returning the item... @Uber @Uber_Support "
2019-07-29 00:57:08+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support can you explain the fare differences? We checked prices at the same time last night, leaving from the same bar, and going to the same address. $15 difference is absurd. "
2019-07-29 00:11:11+00:00,Who’s Rafael? We doing this too? 
2019-07-28 23:16:16+00:00,"Also Uber, why is he operating with expired plates...... sus af"
2019-07-28 22:02:37+00:00,"3 people at the airport told me that they’re uber didn’t move, answer the phone and told them to cancel. Why?! Because they want the fare money and don’t want to pick anyone up. This is NOT ok! @Uber @Uber_Support"
2019-07-28 21:54:00+00:00,HEY @Uber_Support I WAS JUST ASSAULTED BY ONE OF YOUR DRIVERS AND IVE BEEN ON HOLD WITH YOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE FOR 7 MINUTES. HERES PHOTOS OF THE BOTTLE HE THREW AT ME BEFORE HE GRABBED ME FOR TAKING A PHOTO OF HIS LICENSE PLATE 
2019-07-28 15:39:13+00:00,This is not going to go in your favour. My friend had informed you on time requesting to act fast. Your silence is going to play with your reputation and will hurt your business too. We will make a complete chain of complaints against you. @Uber
2019-07-28 13:43:57+00:00,Ur known 10 customers plus 10 mine Now say @Uber_Support
2019-07-28 13:39:47+00:00,"I learned the hard way.@Uber sides with a pax who lied to obtain a ride.Uber will NOT suspend his account,and will NOT pay me a lousy $3 for properly vetting his age.Should something had happened, I saved Uber from a big lawsuit.I will never, ever recommend someone drive for Uber"
2019-07-28 13:31:36+00:00,@Uber_Support What's the matter with you people? You got enough customers to not bother about a single customer.. Believe me I will make sure that you loose atleast 10 customers who are known to me..
2019-07-28 08:01:19+00:00,The stupidity of brainwashed people. Thinking that paying £1.20 to a large corporate to ride in their cars is somehow is helping the environment. Still no info from Uber what happens to the amassed fees if a driver leaves the app. Do Uber pocket it?
2019-07-28 04:42:35+00:00,"Law enforcement is already involved, the heads up is appreciated though. We're just gonna keep airing stuff out until someone on your end actually does something."
2019-07-28 03:19:31+00:00,Help @SoloDarling @uber_support! 
2019-07-28 03:14:13+00:00,How can people help? Can we donate or something?
2019-07-27 21:19:59+00:00,"Do @Uber_Support and @AskLyft make drivers go through sexual harassment training, or is that too much like “following federal labor laws” "
2019-07-27 20:01:47+00:00,@Uber_Support still no reply.
2019-07-27 19:31:01+00:00,But they’re cheap.
2019-07-27 19:02:19+00:00,Yes uber are here to help THEMSELVES TO YOUR MONEY
2019-07-27 18:04:29+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @UberINSupport @Uber_India @Uber_BLR why is there such an inordinate delay in resolving an issue..I see no response from you guys...
2019-07-27 17:26:56+00:00,"12 hours, zero assistance from @Uber_Support - on something so simple like getting a suitcase back...yet so vital to the person needing the suitcase."
2019-07-27 17:02:20+00:00,"Do you even resolve the problem or only reply to the tweets. So that people think that you registered their complain , It's been more than a week and no response from your side. Fake customer support.#quiet #Uber @Uber_Support @Uber"
2019-07-27 13:40:08+00:00,"Hi, @Uber_Support &amp; @Uber, please be better than most corporate automated replies &amp; help my friend. This lost item affects her work and life."
2019-07-27 13:08:20+00:00,Rider: my Uber driver almost got shot at @Uber_Support: k here’s $5 off your next ride now scram 
2019-07-27 12:34:46+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, can you help @SoloDarling ? Thanks!"
2019-07-27 06:34:29+00:00,It's good that you have screenshot of the conversation.. @UberINSupport would have charged you full if it's not the case.. I have experienced many problems witb uber too
2019-07-27 03:48:55+00:00,Day 6 @Uber took money from my @PayPal account. Money that I did not own to Uber. @Uber_Support Denied it and said I was confuesed. I´m going to tweet ever single Day till @Uber takes responsibility. What you ´ve done is not Legal @Uber .
2019-07-27 02:30:11+00:00,"Struggling to get to 90 rides to make $35 less than what I used to get for 70 rides. Would have to work all weekend (totally a full 6-7 days) to make 125 rides to get $190, a whole $5+ what I used to get for 70 rides. @FairTheApp @uber_support @dkhos"
2019-07-26 18:09:01+00:00,can @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India make a rule to not let 2 or less people use mini/micro cabs and opt for pool instead to save fuel?
2019-07-26 05:06:07+00:00,"Dear @Uber_Support , I booked a cab 14 minutes back with a waiting time of 13 minutes but the cab driver is not moving an inch since then , not even taking calls...While trying to cancel you are warNig. Me for Partial charges ??? It's pathetic. Have some shame . "
2019-07-26 04:42:12+00:00,"So, cars don't develop faults like this after inspection?"
2019-07-25 21:04:58+00:00,Or maybe check that YOUR vehicle has all the safety and necessary precautions for carrying passengers
2019-07-25 19:38:51+00:00,"So I am still waiting for my phone call @Uber this is absolutely appalling now, and shows how little respect and value you have of people with a disability. @Meg_HillierMP @SadiqKhan #disabilityrights #humanrights #equality"
2019-07-25 18:49:32+00:00,Nah he said what he said. Y’all weird asf.
2019-07-25 17:51:45+00:00,I think they’re actually trying to find the driver and release her from Uber. From my knowledge your car has to meet a certain standard to drive for Uber and Hers clearly doesn’t
2019-07-25 12:09:33+00:00,No benefits either
2019-07-25 10:51:13+00:00,Yesterday I witnessed an Uber driver hitting someone else’s vehicle and driving off on London Bridge but unfortunately the driver caught him as he got stuck in traffic I hope Trevor makes a full recovery all the best Sir
2019-07-25 09:50:55+00:00,It wasn’t paying shit anyway 
2019-07-25 09:35:11+00:00,Do not report her please
2019-07-25 08:32:50+00:00,:( leave her alone

2019-07-24 23:11:48+00:00,My Uber driver accepted my trip while he was sitting in Popeyes drive thru. @Uber @Uber_Support I need ya to pay me for my dinner
2019-07-24 21:59:37+00:00,Dear @Uber @Uber_Support @UberNigeria this driver of yours is a thief. He hijacked a trip that was cancelled and billed the request on a phantom trip to my card.
2019-07-24 18:57:29+00:00,Twitter is the only way to get ahold of uber. Try it yourself not possible to reach them on the phone
2019-07-24 18:12:08+00:00,"@Uber_Support your insurance just waited 2 days to tell me you won't cover the accident I was in while driving for you because I have private insurance, are you just lying to people when you say you provide liability coverage or what"
2019-07-24 17:15:40+00:00,I just texted James and then called back when I said I would and got another voicemail. If you look at the money I spent in uber in Milan Italy and Barcelona alone the two days before this that should merit at least a call back
2019-07-24 08:02:28+00:00,"WE ARE THE MIDDLE AGED GONE WILD.... If he don’t get an Uber he will have to walk an endless mile. Thank you, I’m here all night "
2019-07-24 04:53:41+00:00,Switch to @Lyft!
2019-07-24 04:15:36+00:00,"Haven't you ever heard of Lyft? Lol. If you're ever in Jersey, my hubby can drive you around. I'm coming for the ride though."
2019-07-24 04:14:05+00:00,"Dude- copy & paste: “Hey Harrison, Ohio- it’s @sebastianbach here. I’m gonna need a few rides around town Friday. Free tickets to my show. Who wants to roll so I can rock?”"
2019-07-24 03:33:13+00:00,They want to discuss what happened and I have called twice just getting voicemails. I will call again seems pretty crazy after all the years and money I have spent on Uber
2019-07-23 20:05:18+00:00,"Don't hold your breath I was hit off my moped end of last year driver ran a red light and drove off when I said I was calling the police , so turning it into a hit and run this despicable company brushed it under the carpet I even had his reg and roundel number @uber"
2019-07-23 14:39:03+00:00,This is disgusting. The Uber driver should be named and shamed. I hope Trevor is not too badly injured. Any vet bills should be sent to the driver. Xx
2019-07-23 14:06:28+00:00,I had an Uber driver kick me out of a cab then try and run me over then pull down a side street with a screwdriver in his hand offered me a fight and I identified the driver through my booking and they done nothing
2019-07-23 09:59:16+00:00,"Uber, you should be ashamed of yourselves "
2019-07-23 08:52:00+00:00,That is poor from Uber. A rtc involving a dog is a reportable RTC. More importantly you would think a professional driver would act in a professional manner and stop and help
2019-07-23 05:53:20+00:00,"It is a criminal offence to not stop if you hit a dog, yet @Uber @Uber_Support are refusing to cooperate &amp; give the details of the driver. If everyone who’s retweeted (almost 2000) stopped using them until they cooperated, it would be quite damaging. "
2019-07-23 05:40:35+00:00,Dear @Uber I Booked a taxi today and your driver Gulshan Kumar Cancelled it saying that I will not go and the booking was transferred to Sachin DL1RT4259 is this the way to harrase a passenger &amp; iam not bound to pay for cancellations charges @Uber_Support @UberINSupport
2019-07-23 02:28:31+00:00,"1. Book Uber. 2. Driver calls, asks for drop location. 3. You tell the drop location. 4. Driver cancels. 5. Go to Step 1. @Uber @Uber_Support @UberFacts @UberEats @Uber_India #Uber"
2019-07-23 01:55:25+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support so I forgot my phone in one of your drivers vehicle and he decided to tip himself 20$on my app phone before finalizing the trip and bring my phone back. Hit me up before I take legal action.
2019-07-22 23:45:21+00:00,Uber taking 40-75% of driver fares. Lyft doing the same damn thing. DoorDash stealing tips from delivery drivers. What’s next? @uber @Uber_Support @lyft @AskLyft @DoorDash
2019-07-22 19:49:27+00:00,The driver has committed an offence under section 170 of the road traffic act 1988 by failing to stop at the scene of an accident including those involving a dog and supplying their name and address reg no and name and address of reg owner to any person with reasonable grounds
2019-07-22 18:51:17+00:00,"@Uber_Support I’ve had a very similar situation with this Uber driver, he gave me “magic brownies” and when I was thirsty he handed me a white claw. Very unsafe"
2019-07-22 16:29:13+00:00,Yes it is..... it has to be reported.....
2019-07-22 15:59:55+00:00,Regardless of who was at fault not to stop was awful and btw an offence. C'mon @Uber_Support do the right thing
2019-07-22 15:17:51+00:00,Get on the local radio ?
2019-07-22 14:53:27+00:00,Hope Trevor is ok my wee dog got knocked down a few weeks unlike the Uber driver stopped and it wasn't his fault Jamie jumped out of the car when I wasn't looking thankfully Jamie was find I hope you get him and he gets charged..
2019-07-22 14:46:53+00:00,Take it to the local newspaper - tell Ober your going to name them for being obstructive. They will lose services. They won't want the bad PR.
2019-07-22 13:37:20+00:00,One of the MANY reasons I would NEVER use @Uber in the UK. Or anywhere for that matter.
2019-07-22 13:21:33+00:00,E mail GGC enforcement unit with the details.
2019-07-22 11:34:57+00:00,Any chance helping find this guy @Gregco_
2019-07-22 07:33:59+00:00,Just took an Uber ride where the expected fare was Rs 284 and I was charged Rs 848! Bizarre!!! @Uber_India obviously doesn’t care @Uber_Support
2019-07-22 04:21:28+00:00,"How can I contact @Uber_Mumbai? Urgent query. By mistake, I have bought 2 ride passes. Will both be valid for 30 days? And available to me one after another? Or there is a limit of one pass per user per month? Do I need to seek a refund, if I bought 2 ride passes? @Uber_Support"
2019-07-22 02:40:00+00:00,"Here to explain, @rabiasquared. Please note that Uber doesn’t take a service fee from tips, so the total tip amount will be added to the driver’s earnings. If you have additional questions, please let us know."
2019-07-21 16:12:52+00:00,Here is the DM in which @uber @Uber_Support tried to get me off of Twitter 
2019-07-21 15:42:15+00:00,".@Uber_Support i switched the payment to use UberCash for a trip last night but i see that both the ubercash was used and a charge on my card, will i be refunded the card charge?"
2019-07-21 15:23:09+00:00,"Hi @Uber @Uber_Support. It's unbelievable that you have not been able to reach your driver who stole my sunglasses last night. I have had no status updates since you tried to get me to stay off Twitter last night for ""privacy"" reasons. Here is, again, the info of the driver: "
2019-07-21 14:53:10+00:00,I wouldn't wish @Uber_Support on my own worst enemy but whatdya expect from a company that can't figure out pizza delivery or not sexually abusing their own customers I guess?

2019-07-21 09:29:54+00:00,What is with the sudden additional exit charge (INR 40) that @Uber_India is now charging at airport? Never have I been asked to pay earlier? @Uber_Support – at Chennai Domestic Terminal (MAA)
2019-07-21 05:10:48+00:00,.@uber @Uber_Support @lyft @lyftdesignteam product feature request: can you PLEASE add a “smoking ok” option? I’d rather decline a driver right away than die of asthma in the back.
2019-07-21 02:15:05+00:00,I always screenshot and then send a message to them to say I have a small manual wheelchair that folds up on the seat. 3/5 drivers always cancel.

2019-07-20 21:01:54+00:00,"Thank you, @Uber_Support + @Uber, for charging me a cancelation fee when your third (3rd) driver in a row cancelled on me. That’s lovely, I look forward to receiving this cash back in 3-5 business days"

2019-07-19 22:36:32+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support @ThomasTyoung16 So your company doesn’t care about the lives of the passengers who pay for your service? My current ride - fearing for my life on this highway no less.... I want my money back!
2019-07-19 20:55:48+00:00,"Joke of the Day :- @Uber_India : There're 5 cabs near you, just 2 mins away. Want to book ? Me: Yes, book it! Uber : Done. Your Uber will take 20 mins. @Uber_Support @kumarmanish9"
2019-07-19 16:29:10+00:00,Sorry to hear that but due to low fares drivers have to work long hours to earn minimum wage. Consider other options in the future
2019-07-19 15:56:39+00:00,"Thanks so much for doing this and keeping cyclists and pedestrians safe from this driver! @Uber_Support please post actions you took to remove this dangerous driver. Otherwise, as noted in this thread, no one believes you do anything."

2019-07-19 14:02:33+00:00,"We take this very seriously, @lmcanty. Please send us a DM with the location where this particular incident happened, so we can connect ASAP."

2019-07-19 02:52:51+00:00,"@Uber_Support my Uber driver was very unprofessional. He kept screming in my face, sounded like he was repeating “you’re never gonna make it” over and over again. However, he had an accent that seemed to be faded so I couldn’t tell. Snapped this pic before I ran away. pic.twitter.com/uS2JPzskat"
2019-07-18 21:28:22+00:00,You read correct. $1000. They charged people on Wednesday 100x the price of their ride or ubereats orders. I read stories of $9000 charges. So the money is still on hold and some accounts frozen over it.
2019-07-18 18:34:48+00:00,When your @Uber driver claims to have picked you up and is now driving around trying to build up the fare... worst part is I can’t book another until he is done @Uber_Support
2019-07-18 18:19:01+00:00,hello my driver didn’t even drive me anywhere she just sat there and ate fruit @Uber_Support 
2019-07-18 16:11:11+00:00,"hi @Uber_Support! U had a service interruption and a higher fare was held from my account. Funny that higher fare was the EXACT amt of my ENTIRE CHECKING ACCOUNT. Watch out ppl, @uber has the ability to wipe ur bank act! I hav $0 &amp; it takes 3-5 biz days for balance restoration :)"
2019-07-18 14:36:19+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support, this is ridiculous. My ride was actually only $10.30. A “sorry for the inconvenience” email doesn’t really cut it when my account was over-drafted and my card was unexpectedly declined while trying to book another ride. "

2019-07-18 07:20:56+00:00,Does @UberINSupport ever charge according to its estimates these days? I don’t remember the last time it said 150-180 and actually charged that much. Next level robbery of customers naa? @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-07-18 02:39:13+00:00,"Okay. So. I’m not tripping! I was charged $2,012 for a ubereats order that was only supposed to $20.12 and have yet to receive any kind of help!!! @Uber_Support "
2019-07-18 02:12:24+00:00,I’m so glad @Uber_Support is choosing to ignore me instead of telling me that I will get my $870.00 that they wrongfully took back 
2019-07-18 01:07:05+00:00,@Uber_Support I took a 10 minute Uber that was supposed to cost $11.36 but my account now has a pending amount of $1113.00 and there is no way to contact customer service over the phone to dispute the charge. Can some pls let me know what’s being done about this glitch?!?!?
2019-07-18 00:05:44+00:00,"Whatever you do, do not take @Uber!!! They just charge me $1,440 for a $14.40 ride and claimed it was an “error”. @Uber_Support"
2019-07-18 00:03:00+00:00,How my husband feels about #uber these days. Ruined his birthday.
2019-07-18 00:01:58+00:00,"We absolutely want to take a closer look, MIchael! Please confirm your phone number associated with your Uber account through DM, so we can connect right away."
2019-07-17 23:35:26+00:00,"They charged me 2,053 on a ride that was $20.53 and no one is trying to assist! I’ve written several messages!!"
2019-07-17 23:33:57+00:00,This issue is not fixed. This is unacceptable. I never agreed to almost an $800 payment- this is theft. Please address now as this is a top priority. A very poor display of lack of customer care. Hope you improve.
2019-07-17 23:17:31+00:00,@Uber_Support I’m so disappointed in your company they overcharged me $700!!!! Absolutely ridiculous. I feel so robbed. They have not responded. So appalled at their customer service right now.
2019-07-17 22:51:29+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support There is absolutely no valid reason to have a temporary charge that high.
2019-07-17 19:11:00+00:00,"This @uber and @lyft car is being driven without a plate. This driver was savvy enough to use an @Uber_Support sticker to conceal their VIN. Good to know that rideshare companies don't care. Again, if someone picks you up in this car, don't get in. Call the police. "
2019-07-17 18:27:26+00:00,"Last night I tried to take an Uber to a wrap party they were having for one of my comedy films...and Uber refused to accept the ride because they said the address was “unsafe.” Like...what the hell is that supposed to mean, and who at @Uber_Support makes that decision?"

2019-07-17 17:30:49+00:00,"You missed the point of the tweet, buddy."
2019-07-17 16:47:41+00:00,Dear @Uber @Uber_Support you are pathetic. When I was booking fr cab the amount was showing 258 rs. But you charged 512. Just double. Got mad or what 
2019-07-17 15:29:24+00:00,Does @Uber_Support - Do you screen your drivers? Do you know how rude &amp; threatening your drivers are? They are the face of your company &amp; so far you are doing a horrific job! I don't take Uber anymore. I use Cabs &amp; Car Service specifically because of this! @CAMARSHALLSTAR
2019-07-17 03:13:51+00:00,"Nonsense, except in jurisdictions that mandate proper criminal and licence history checks the Uber checks are little better than a special google search regular missing all manner of previous acts. No rideshare training or driver education or testing occurs anywhere. #TryATaxi"
2019-07-17 02:52:14+00:00,It’s a DISGRACE! I have already reported this horrible person! @Uber_Support @Robbiezombie
2019-07-17 02:42:33+00:00,The SECOND most HORRIFFIC experience with an abusive @Uber @Uber_Support driver in a 2 weeks span! I am DONE WITH you UBER! Do you always allow criminal-types to drive people around Uber and SCREAM at their passengers?!!!!!!? WTF!???? #NOTCOOL!
2019-07-16 14:03:21+00:00,Nah. You'll just say you don't have enough info or some other cop-out. You care infinitely more about protecting your drivers from real-world consequences than you ever do about safety. You have all the info you need in the tweet. Fill out the report yourselves and take action!
2019-07-16 12:33:36+00:00,"So, @UberEats @Uber_Support have terrible customer service. As a restaurant partner we give UberEats 30% of every sale for responses like this. 7 days now an no help. Just an awful company to be a partner with. "

2019-07-15 15:00:12+00:00,very frustating when @Uber started calculating wait the movement they enter society gate inspite of providing exact GPS location and informing driver well in advance. You guys need a way to cheat customer rather review/modify ur support model. @Uber_Support

2019-07-13 02:34:58+00:00,Sure would be great if @Uber_Support honored their word to disallow under 5* ratings with no feedback given. At the very least evaluate the drivers rating history and dismiss these arbitrary ratings. Had 1*rating today no feedback given and my overall dropped.

2019-07-09 18:25:03+00:00,Hi Victoria Sorry you have had to go through this. Refusal of service from taxi drivers is sadly not uncommon but being charged for the privilege is. We have no role in investigating individual complaints but both @EqualityCommNI and @ConsumerCouncil can help you 1/2
2019-07-09 18:15:35+00:00,"Hey Sophie, I’m glad you’re ok, that must have been a horrible experience and potentially horrific. I used to use @Uber , not anymore. I’d rather support my local cabs and in London, black cabs, can be more expensive, often not &amp; safer. Uber can cancel while you wait."

Why make the drivers suffer ? Take care of the drivers don't manipulate them with false incentives and lies

2019-07-07 12:34:42+00:00,"You might want to reassess that thought. London cabs have a reputation for returning lost property to the owner directly or via the Lost Property Office, Baker St. Last night a fellow driver returned a bag containing 4 passports to the owners after a 25 min drive across London."
2019-07-07 10:43:04+00:00,"Anoush, You say the driver confirmed they have the bag, in that case I suggest you report to @TfLTPH as the Licensor of Uber.

2019-07-06 22:06:35+00:00,FYI: @Uber_Support responded by giving me a $3 credit to my account on my $23 ride. I would have preferred a “fuck you and your safety”. Probably would have stung a little less.
2019-07-06 16:29:25+00:00,Trust me they can track this guy down immediately. They deactivate drivers for farting too loud I’m surprised this has taken this long. Good luck Kiku

2019-07-05 16:43:53+00:00,Just had the worst ride of my life with @Uber. What was meant to be a 3 minute wait became over 30 minute and the driver behaved in a very unprofessional manner. And what even makes it worse is that I was charged for his mistake. @Uber_Support
2019-07-05 16:25:33+00:00,"Yeah, your follow-through on thee incidents really has is doubting. Maybe this one some action could be taken? This was a driver who was doing just the action of stopping for a stop sign without acknowledging he was at an intersection where other road users could be."
2019-07-05 15:46:49+00:00,Honking at me after trying to roll through the crosswalk I was using is prime @Uber_Support behavior. Or maybe @lyft Almost got hit because of inattentive driver and he’s now made impatient by a pedestrian presence. Hope the passenger noticed and complains.

2019-07-04 20:36:10+00:00,Really @uber @Uber_Support @Uber_SL? This is a bloody joke. Don’t want a refund because the driver said he followed the map and was a nice person. Please fix your app and charge initial estimated amount.

2019-07-03 13:47:00+00:00,Why does @Uber insist its drivers wear suits and drive here in the UAE It's 46 degrees out there. It's nothing but a colonial carry forward. I am certain passengers wouldn't be offended if their drivers wore smart tees and cargos. @Uber_Support #uae #mydubai
2019-07-03 11:48:12+00:00,My Uber driver is hitting on me and just gave me his number and said “hey if you ever want to talk just give me a call and I’ll give you a nice discount” He was asking for my age and asking super personal questions. I was so uncomfortable @uber @Uber_Support
2019-07-03 08:43:14+00:00,@Uber_Support never again will I pay for your disgusting services. Allowing your greedy drivers to select routes so they can overcharge me! @kaptenuk you have a new customer.

2019-06-28 20:31:24+00:00,"There are a number of reasons. For example if you ha e a low battery, you'll get a higher price because you're more likely to accept. If you regularly pay more, that also increases the chance that you'll get overcharged, cos you pay up."

2019-06-27 18:59:33+00:00,FYI: @Uber @Uber_Support still hasn’t contacted me about why I’m banned. This business wants drunk drivers on the road. Friends please do not support or use UBER.
2019-06-27 18:09:51+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber_NYC @uber How does one get a refund when the driver is pulled over mid-trip to JFK by police for not paying previous tolls? I had to order another car mid-trip take me to the airport. This is negligence. Vehicle is being towed. I may miss my flight.
2019-06-27 09:49:42+00:00,One hour later after asking me to send a DM no respond. @Uber @Uber_Support @UberNigeria
2019-06-26 23:47:39+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support my driver said he won’t take me anywhere unless I step out of the car and take this picture. It was very late and he kept asking random people on the street to do this with him until some random guy obliged. Is this normal??? 
2019-06-26 22:56:38+00:00,Uber DOES NOT have any people working in customer service. Keep emailing them until you get tired & go away. Enjoy your new TECHNOLOGY app. 
2019-06-26 18:33:36+00:00,I don't think you quite understand. I found the problem. The problem is an improperly uploaded ad image that causes the desktop version of your trips page to be unusable. This isn't a problem with my browser. This is a problem with the website itself.
2019-06-26 17:31:24+00:00,"I swear I'm being punked by @Uber and @Uber_Support. Been having an issue for DAYS, and they just keep sending the SAME canned emails and DM's to me over and over. I reply with screenshots of the issue, and they reply again with the same thing. What is even going on!!???"
2019-06-26 14:09:17+00:00,Also if driver does not cancel and drives away of pickup point forcing customer to cancel. Driver should be penalized
2019-06-26 13:54:38+00:00,My Uber from Saturday never hit me up to return my weed pen I left in the back when I was hammered. What the fuck? @Uber_Support
2019-06-26 13:47:04+00:00,"If the driver cancels the ride, there should be an automatic shutdown of any charges. This is a design flaw that some drivers are exploiting. Honest taxi companies (taxis Sinai and Emanuel) are becoming good options again ..."
2019-06-26 13:34:07+00:00,Having a driver NOT cancel your ride while driving away is completely unacceptable. You are literally held hostage to their bad intentions
2019-06-26 12:47:17+00:00,"Everything around discrimination from @Uber drivers in El Salvador, where way too many violate @Uber_Support community guidelines by discriminating against payment methods, is long way due to be regulated in the platform. Great company with flawed execution in Central America."
2019-06-26 08:04:05+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_Kolkata would you care to respond? When i say good things, you respond in a jiffy, make us take calls &amp; shoot for you free of cost, cause that is publicity. When it's the other way round, you disappear?"
2019-06-25 22:26:19+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support can someone send me another canned response about my problem so I can spend another week frustrated with your lack of customer support? Maybe something like “Hey Kenneth we know you expect a seamless experience when riding with us...blah, blah”"
2019-06-25 22:05:10+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support is super trash. They told me to dm to progress find my keys that have been missing for two weeks now and ghosted me. Costing me money and a huge inconvenience. Haven't responded to 3 people for a lost item report. No accountability. I'll never uber again 
2019-06-25 21:36:26+00:00,@Uber_Support never used uber but had it loaded in case. Got a charge for ride request I never requested and cancellation charge. How can that happen? No refund just a credit on account I will never use now due mischarging. Had to contact bank to stop payment. RIDICULOUS.
2019-06-25 19:53:37+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @UberEats could you stop sending SMSs to my phone about promotions? I didn't sign up for that and there is no opt-out on the app.
2019-06-25 18:53:32+00:00,There's not one part of this that's even remotely ok. @Uber @Uber_Support Yikes!!
2019-06-25 15:44:21+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support , when will you start charging a cancellation fee for drivers that cancel a trip after waiting for them more than 5 minutes?"
2019-06-25 15:42:40+00:00,"Dear @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_Kolkata is this how you treat passengers? When your driver helped me, I spoke about it &amp; u used it for publicity. What happens when a passenger has a horrific experience? u go quiet? Driver details : Abhijit. Car number is WB 05 5196"
2019-06-25 10:23:39+00:00,I had to cancel a trip cause the driver said it was a card trip and now I was debited for inconvenience. @UberNigeria @Uber_Support are you mad or are you mad ?
2019-06-25 01:30:11+00:00,It was so wasteful from every angle
2019-06-25 01:26:33+00:00,"Oh I definitely let them know both by email and on the phone that it was ridiculous that they didn’t care about making their driver make a drive out for nothing, it’s ridiculous that there was literally no way to cancel the order and save the driver a trip."
2019-06-24 20:59:29+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber since the time I’ve made my account I am facing trouble with payment options - NONE of them are working &amp; it is kinda weird it halts my journey kindly help
2019-06-24 14:45:21+00:00,Nooooooooooo!!! I not seen this one before? Beats the one stuck on steps trying to get into Liverpool st hands down!! 
2019-06-24 12:54:08+00:00,"I'm sorry,but I can't help laughing at you."
2019-06-24 12:07:31+00:00,"Driver cancellation is major issue in India. Uber : Not anymore dependable. Booked zoomcar in my last trip and Parking car overnight in airport is better option than calling Uber. @Uber_Support, @Uber_India : Are you listening ?"
2019-06-24 07:20:35+00:00,So we ordered two pizza yesterday from Smokin Joes wadala outlet through @UberEats_IND and the image shows how did we receive the order. Raised an issue through the app saying the order was damaged and gave all photos and reasons. No reply till today. Bad service! @Uber_Support 
2019-06-24 07:12:50+00:00,.@UberUK @Uber_Support appalling service with Uber Exec this morning. Waited 10 minutes for car to LHR to arrive (fine) and then he tells me he has another job and can only take me as far as Paddington. WTF? Maybe get your drivers to look at the jobs they’re accepting!
2019-06-24 04:56:12+00:00,He’s sad the restaurants are closed calm the f down
2019-06-24 03:51:56+00:00,"The same drivers drive for Lyft and cancelling undesireable trips is easier on Lyft than Uber. i know you dont believe me, but when (not if) Lyft burns you, remember that some troll on twitter told you they were identical piles of garbage"
2019-06-23 22:01:32+00:00,So #UberEATS @Uber_Support because you guys have fucked up on almost every order I've made I get to pay for a sandwich I never got? Lol #uninstalled pic.twitter.com/VRHgSI3wR1
2019-06-23 18:29:49+00:00,When are you going to create an option to request a female driver? This shit keeps happening to us and y’all still won’t make that commitment? @AskLyft @Uber_Support 
2019-06-23 18:15:42+00:00,Fk off and start charging some realistic prices Those of us that refuse to work for your illegal predatory pricing are going nowhere
2019-06-23 18:04:37+00:00,The @Uber and @Uber_Support did reach out via DM and the response is laughable. Don't take my word for it. Here's a screenshot. Default responses and repeated requests for ratings. 
2019-06-23 15:30:26+00:00,Very disappointed!!!! Why am I charged with it??? @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_Delhi
2019-06-23 14:45:58+00:00,Stand and Deliver #UberMug pic.twitter.com/zNdvgtYyD1
2019-06-23 09:59:58+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support why did my Uber cancel on me as soon as he pulled up &amp; when I went to order another one it was $4 more?
2019-06-23 09:34:03+00:00,"Again faced the same issue today. Same overcharging of Rs 231 above the bill under the head 'tolls, surcharges and bills'. Why is this happening repeatedly @Uber_Support? I believe this is a bug in your billing system. Plz correct it. "
2019-06-23 05:11:41+00:00,"I suspect Uber's threat of termination is more about her low usage (she rides alone rarely), though it's disguised as ""poor rating so we'll throw you out"". I doubt it they're threatening every rider with a rating above 4 of 5 points, which would be straight out of #BlackMirror."
2019-06-23 01:00:22+00:00,Uber Eats ready to help the pans at any time go Uber Eats
2019-06-22 23:23:09+00:00,It looks like @Uber also thinks you’re a driver. Is this moment the singularity we’ve been hearing about?
2019-06-22 23:19:53+00:00,I just agreed with you bc im pan but ok thanks
2019-06-22 13:24:35+00:00,"21 hours after I’ve tried *everything* to reach them, @Uber_India finally sends me an email saying they’re UNABLE to reach their own driver-partner and that my lost items aren’t their “responsibility”. Gee thanks @Uber @Uber_Support thanks for the “support” "
2019-06-22 10:16:25+00:00,One is US dollars the other is Canadian dollars.
2019-06-22 08:02:22+00:00,Have already done my part and emailed before. No but thank you anyways
2019-06-22 06:23:04+00:00,"Can’t believe some cheeky fucker has just got in kanes Uber and the driver has actually dropped them off at their destination and let kane pay for the taxi? @Uber_Support resulting in him not getting to work, missing a days wage because he’d get sent home for being late anyway"
2019-06-22 05:26:39+00:00,The ride fare was 176.91 and the amount deducted or I was asked to pay was 779. This was last week and I was told this issue will be resolved just make the payment. Still didn't get my money back @Uber @Uber_Support Sent a message on Facebook too but no help. 
2019-06-22 04:30:57+00:00,"Hey @Uber_India I have been charged wait time fee because your driver said ""meet me"" and didn't show up for 15 min. Please look into the issue. @Uber_Support @Uber"
2019-06-22 02:39:28+00:00,This is some serious bullshit! I just caught @Uber charging tourists more for the same ride. I have a US and Canadian phone. These images represent the same ride. US phone is almost $10 more than Canadian one. Care to explain @Uber_Support? pic.twitter.com/TettzRu7NL
2019-06-22 00:54:11+00:00,So i want this driver fired @Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats This drive was so unproffesional leaving my girl with another customer stranded on the st thomas bridge in pedro.
2019-06-21 20:33:44+00:00,Here we go again. Why not just pull over ten feet sooner and do it legally?
2019-06-21 18:33:21+00:00,"It should be easy to trace this, her things is between the driver and a person who requested right after her...... Don't fail her Uber Support!!!"
2019-06-21 16:28:54+00:00,"It doesn't help me one bit to learn about a music festival three hours from me in Deleware. What I want Uber to do is show a heat map of passenger demand, That way I can go there when I'm not getting any requests. @Uber_Support "

2019-06-21 08:35:15+00:00,So @Uber_Support @Uber sent me a code for free delivery on Uber eats. Then it said I wasn’t eligible. Contacted support who repeatedly explained “I’m not part of the target group” but can’t explain why I was sent the code in the first place quality marketing mate.
2019-06-21 08:29:46+00:00,Not to pile on but we pay our taxes too
2019-06-21 03:42:31+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I've been watching the projected delivery time of my @UberEats order go up for the past 1.5-2 hours but it's not getting cancelled or changing status. What do I do?
2019-06-21 03:23:18+00:00,i have a feeling this automated response didn’t read the thread.
2019-06-20 21:15:56+00:00,We are outraged with Uber! #uber @uber @uber_support

2019-06-20 07:49:09+00:00,Sending a SAR mission in Ormuz right now is a bit tricky I guess. That's OK I will go for chinese food delivered through the Silk Road. Safer. Thank you.
2019-06-20 07:43:12+00:00,"That's ok, just received some news (bad for my meals actually) from @DeptofDefense."
2019-06-19 17:45:50+00:00,"In today’s portrait of courage, we have #AB5 supporter call me a name and then immediately block me. His header image shows @Uber_Support in ruin with #Uber drivers burning with it. It looks like a terroristic threat to me. @TwitterSafety"

2019-06-19 14:14:39+00:00,Dynamic pricing is seriously interesting and wholly immoral. This article fleshes out quite a bit of it. #RaceToTheBottom #PsychopathsParadise
2019-06-19 13:48:52+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberUK extremely rude and unprofessional thing to do. I was in the car. My ride gets cancelled. The driver rudely asks me to get off the car in rain. Extremely racist and obnoxious person. Pathetic service
2019-06-19 12:27:38+00:00,"In addition to all the other things you're being told, your remaining battery power is also a factor. If your battery is low, you're more likely to accept a higher price before your phone goes flat. You agreed to it when you accepted Uber's Ts&Cs."
2019-06-19 07:56:45+00:00,"Been charged £160 by Uber for ‘car damage’ for no reason what so ever, awful treatment of customers, taking money out of peoples accounts without investigating cases thoroughly, not something you expect from a major company @Uber_Support"

2019-06-19 04:59:44+00:00,Lol nah. When I reported it y’all said you couldn’t tell me what happened with the driver for “privacy reasons” and marked my case as “resolved.” I didn’t even get a refund.
2019-06-19 04:22:50+00:00,Actually @UberEats_IND &amp; @Uber_India don't respond to my tweets too. Tey tagging in @uber to see if they can intervene and force the bum lazy Indian arm to react.
2019-06-19 01:59:50+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support @uber_dc why do me and my friend get different prices for the exact same ride? We did it at the same time and location. Since the pics have home addresses I can share them privately. There may also be interest from the media to know this is occurring. #fairness
2019-06-18 23:52:00+00:00,"Thanks @Uber_Support, Uber got us the phone number of the driver who's been very helpful. Now we need to work on getting the phone back to my building during this short trip. DMing you now. Thank you!"
2019-06-18 22:15:24+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support I left my cell phone in the car that dropped me off at the airport. I cant access my security code sent to the car. Can you assist?
2019-06-18 20:21:04+00:00,"If @Uber used #Digi-ID it would be a lot easier. It’s a more secure, open source login method. You should ask @ANTUMID @changeangel_io @mctrivia or @noahseidman. Seems like any business should be interested in a free way to offer a more secure and efficient UI."
2019-06-18 18:58:34+00:00,".@Uber_Support @uber you need to do something about this immediately. That driver should be fired, arrested, and charged with kidnapping. KEEP WOMEN SAFE ON YOUR PLATFORM, YOU PIECES OF GARBAGE."

2019-06-18 12:33:49+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support pretty sketchy my driver tried to pick me up in a different car(color and license plate) than reported on the app. 
2019-06-18 10:01:06+00:00,"You have a pretty bad reputation for your customer service and I can see why. If you've interpreted her experience as ""frustrating"" you either don't understand how terrifying this is or you simply don't care. She was effectively kidnapped by one of your drivers!

2019-06-18 03:51:57+00:00,How unsafe uber is no number to call for help when driver threat you to pay in cash after starting the trip and threats you to stop in between and creates scene near your home. Thanks uber for such unsafe drivers. Paid in cash and again paid uber. @Uber @Uber_Support

2019-06-17 17:25:53+00:00,£94 is reasonable for a journey of that distance. £61 is the unrealistic predatory price to reel in the gullible!!!!

2019-06-17 13:16:01+00:00,"This is the biggest problem with @UberEats_IND. If rider cheats, fine comes on the customer which is totally pathetic. Uber is hiring riders without verification and without asking customer as to whether they have paid the amount, it is added in Uber account."

2019-06-14 21:30:24+00:00,Dear @UberEats team: would it be too complicated to add an App feature where consumers could specify whether they need plastic throw-away cutlery or not?

2019-05-25 01:22:06+00:00,This @Uber_Support driver tried to hit me with his car while I was riding in a bike lane. He threatened by accelerating toward me and screaming profanities while he had passengers in his car. This behavior is unacceptable on our streets and he should be cited for this. 
2019-05-24 21:47:13+00:00,Damn change your passwords @UberEats @Uber_RSA @Uber_Support need to find out what location the food was delivered to or the trips taken. This is insane.
2019-05-24 13:54:03+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support @UberFR @UberEats This is unprofessional and intolerable! I paid for food that your rider delivered all spilled out which I had to refuse so took it back. But you charged me for this and aren't willing to reimburse me!! Is this how you treat your customer? 
2019-05-24 11:31:44+00:00,Still no reply or any sort of communication from your end. So much for customer care service. Why should we use #ubereats?? Worst service from such leading brands @Uber_Support #shuttheapp

2019-05-21 17:48:12+00:00,Why you would only want to look in to that particular matter? As drivers come from many other places it should be made mandatory by your organisation to teach them basic #Kannada to serve the people.

2019-05-16 00:32:26+00:00,I hope you realize that this protest of yours does not get the message across to Uber. That innocent person driving you around does not pick the route for an Uber pool ride. The driver doesn't see how many passengers they will have or where the destinations are.

2019-05-13 08:43:50+00:00,"Now I understand why I get promo every week on my #Uber, it's because of my rating. I hit 4.60 yesterday.. Now I get 650 naira off every ride.. @Uber @Uber_Support y'all rock.."
2019-05-13 05:57:01+00:00,"Apparently I am in this Uber ride lol. Idk who the guy is driving? My soul? @Uber_Support I don’t get why there is no helpline, what do I do?The guy didn’t even reach my house, started the ride way before, I called him to cancel Cz mine wasn’t doing so and he just went w/o me. "
2019-05-13 05:36:48+00:00,Had an amazing start to the day with an Uber ride courtesy Mr.Abdul Qadeer. His efforts in ensuring customer service is unlike anything I've seen till date.

2019-05-13 01:56:32+00:00,"My uber driver went to the wrong pickup spot, then went down a one-way street and drove away, literally waving at me. After five minutes of waiting, @Uber slaps me with a $5 cancellation fee AND the driver gave me a 1 star, ruining my perfect 5.0 in the process. @Uber_Support"
2019-05-12 02:10:28+00:00,Hope @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_Canada didn’t make your Saturday more dangerous by stopping in the #BikeTO lane. #VisionZeroTO @TorontosMayor
2019-05-11 22:17:41+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support my last 3 trips, I’ve been charged more than the initial price I’m shown, care to explain?"
2019-05-11 21:52:37+00:00,"I'd say @uber_support , but they're basically non-existent .. "
2019-05-11 20:00:07+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support? Your driver just parked in such a way that he blocked my car in at a gas station. When I told him about it, he went back inside, furthering delaying my leaving. "
2019-05-11 17:31:41+00:00,@Uber_Support your driver almost ran us into a truck because he wouldn’t take my route or cancel my ride I have all the information I need to sue your company my lady is in the middle off the street with me terrified

2019-05-11 08:57:05+00:00,"So today I was looking through @UberEats @Uber_Support and I had a couple things in my cart, but thought not my thing and closed the window. (We ended up ordering elsewhere) 40 minute later, food is being delivered and I was charged but I swear never ordered that meal. #poor"
2019-05-11 07:54:36+00:00,"Hi @Uber_Support i just witnessed my uber driver get racially abused in sydney, the abuser was threatening to report my driver for something he didn't do. Can you direct me an email to contact, I want to make sure the driver is okay."
2019-05-11 07:14:49+00:00,"To put me in a position where I have to wait 20 minutes *twice* is absolutely irresponsible and continues to be discriminatory towards wheelchair users. @Uber @Uber_Support, you need to do a much better job at getting your UberWAV program right. Tonight was a complete #UberFail"
2019-05-11 00:41:39+00:00,"Sir, they are NOT Uber's customer at all, they are just stage PROPS to make the 'business' look LEGAL. Why don't people GET this??"
2019-05-10 23:04:37+00:00,So @Uber @Uber_Support has not paid me in almost two weeks and I’m about to contact the news and my lawyer because I’m sure that’s against some law. Everytime I reach out to them they send a generic message and is not fixing the issue. So if you want to go that route we def can.
2019-05-10 22:27:02+00:00,This is how I wanted to respond but unfortunately @Uber_Support’s chat doesn’t accept gifs ... 
2019-05-10 18:44:41+00:00,"I just love @Uber_Support double charging me for a driver that didn't want to go ""that far"" then having absolutely no way for me to call support to get my money back. Why would a business want you to tweet support instead of calling?"
2019-05-10 18:43:53+00:00,No clearly you're right. We should do nothing improve our conditions and consent to be victimized by everyone because of these supremely novel and trenchant rationales no one has ever proposed before.
2019-05-10 17:58:01+00:00,2. You could do this. It would be rather simple. And it will start a revolution. You need a name. How about Spartacus? @AFLCIO @UberFacts @Uber_Support @Uber_India @AskLyft @AskLyft @AOC
2019-05-10 16:46:36+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberUK please tell me why I have been charged a £110 cleaning fee for spilling a tiny amount of drink last night!!!!??????
2019-05-10 13:12:52+00:00,I have worked with your support in the App. They have said there is no other option but to pay $3.xx charge for the ride I was abused and harassed on. I am left with no other option but to #deleteuber and dispute the charge. Below par customer service @Uber @Uber_Support 
2019-05-10 04:28:50+00:00,"Contd.. when he asked about the payment, I said Card, he asked me to cancel the ride after making me wait for a long time (he was 300 mts away from me when called). After doing all these, this @Uber_Support will make me pay for cancelling it Stupid idiots @ola_supports and Uber"
2019-05-10 04:26:08+00:00,"First, I booked an @Olacabs @ola_supports to make use of my Ola Money and the driver cancelled after making me wait for a few mins cos I am not paying him with cash. Fed up with him and moved to @Uber @Uber_Support and the a****** made me for 20 long mins before calling me (1/2) "
2019-05-10 01:30:14+00:00,"Seriously, can we all report the world's third scariest, sweariest, most aggressive driver in the US, @Uber_Support? Fourth at best."
2019-05-09 23:34:12+00:00,I’ve been trying to get @Uber to get me access to my account for months. Still getting ads but no help. Meanwhile @lyft gets all my money (@Uber_Support ) 
2019-05-09 17:13:26+00:00,"Fun story. I’m a Platinum @Uber rider and decided to try Uber Comfort (more expensive than X, cheaper than Black). I noticed that I received no rewards or status points for my trips. I contacted @Uber_Support and got a wall of Terms of Service thrown at me."
2019-05-09 14:14:54+00:00,The more I drive for @Uber the more I realize why people were boycotting them yesterday. @Uber_Support is useless and the platform has become a mess. Thanks for fucking up my week. 2 years of driving to be treated like this 
2019-05-09 12:51:47+00:00,"Hello @Uber_Support #Uber, I am trying to connect with your customer care from last 2 days but your line is always busy and call disconnected. I have lost my bag in last ride and I am not able to contact with Driver or Customer care.. please help me."
2019-05-09 12:47:48+00:00,Culprit caught and phone recovered @Uber_Support shame on your fucking pathetic support and service. Cooperation and response from your headquarters Islamabad was pathetic throughout and we are going to sue you in court and as per law 
2019-05-09 12:37:55+00:00,And almost a month later and still haven’t gotten my money back from @uber funny how @Uber_Support says there working on it but there not so @UbersTruth they changed me 25 dollar for an Uber that never came and got me called me and told me to cancel
2019-05-09 11:55:29+00:00,My friend @DivyaMangotra is stuck in your Car where the driver has cancelled the trip after letting her in and moving. He now denying duty. Do you have any sense of customer safety? Comfort is beyond your capability anyway. @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_India @Uber_Support
2019-05-09 08:56:47+00:00,We need an immediate ban on @Uber in India! @Uber_Support @Uber_India really need to take a step back and reconsider the safety measures offered by them!

2019-05-09 03:46:07+00:00,"Well, the update on this thread is that there remains no acceptable resolution from @uber or follow up in my app from the @Uber_Support folks as promised yesterday. So, maybe I need some more advice @Nezhune cause this complacency with women’s safety is not sitting well."
2019-05-08 23:55:10+00:00,"I heard that @Uber doesnt allow drivers to record in their car. What kind of backwars rule is that? Thats the best way for both Drivers and Passengers to stay safe. Its evidence, take it from a guy who some filthy Uber Driver scammed $155 using fraud. @Uber_Support was no help. "
2019-05-08 21:30:46+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, I tried using your service but it turns out I'm not a scab. Argh please help! (by paying and supporting your drivers equitably)"

2019-05-08 19:03:36+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support say you take #stickysurge #pennysurge with you. Until they say you don’t.
2019-05-08 15:30:24+00:00,I seem to have got @Uber_Support very confused as they don't seem to understand you can have multiple valid email addresses that point to the same email account (e.g. tim+a@foo.com and tim+b@foo.com) as per the RFC.
2019-05-08 15:01:42+00:00,I will not be using @Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats @lyft @AskLyft...pay your employees. #UberLyftStrike #UberShutDown #lyftstrike
2019-05-08 14:45:45+00:00,I haven't taken a @Uber in weeks and I get charged $31 last night. I looked at recent trips and I don't have any. You guys just taking money nowadays? @Uber_Support
2019-05-08 12:17:56+00:00,"Hey @Uber, please make a “Scooby DUber” mode where we can get Ubers with our dogs! We’d gladly give you all our money to make sure our good boys can have a good time too! You’re welcome @Uber_Support "
2019-05-08 12:03:16+00:00,It’s that simple. If @AskLyft @Uber_Support charges $40 pay driver $30 and not $20 or less
2019-05-08 07:37:30+00:00,Uber driver at Bangalore Airport making a choice of destination. Refuses to go and prefers a longer distance customer. Gross indiscipline. Defies even Uber Executive. @PrParameswaran @Uber_Support #Uber
2019-05-08 05:51:55+00:00,". @Uber_Support Rs 1300 from my Paytm wallet has been deducted unfairly. Since past two years I haven't been able to use the app, I don't even have it installed in my phone. Just because I have linked my wallet that doesn't mean you guys can steal the money."
2019-05-08 03:16:00+00:00,"Speaking of fast food places, I ordered McDonald's via @UberEats and it said delivery time was 30 minutes. Well, it's been 32 minutes and they're ""still preparing"" so really great :-) (but seriously tho. it isn't great. these wait times are getting ridiculous) @Uber_Support"
2019-05-08 02:54:19+00:00,Dealing with @Uber_Support is an absolute nightmare. It’s basically impossible to escalate and talk to a real person. Anyone have any tips for dealing with them?
2019-05-07 22:44:33+00:00,"Dudes, I love @Uber_Support - but this driver was awful. Aggressive, Parked 2 mins away for five minutes, went to the wrong place then accused me of being wrong, then cancelled. Get these morons off your register. No time for Raja.... "
2019-05-07 20:25:01+00:00,"FYI. @Uber_Support never got back to me about my @UberEats food that was never delivered, soooooo definitely not ordering from them anymore. Hey @Postmates can you guys expand your delivery area, I'm just outside where you deliver."

2019-05-07 12:21:10+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber_India never expected this kind of fraud from you. Booked Uber share with the expected fare of Rs79 . But had to pay Rs 138 for the same trip. This is not acceptable at all.
2019-05-07 02:00:10+00:00,That moment you’re in an @Uber and the driver’s car goes on fire. That. ... and still no call from @Uber_Support. Madness.

That’s a start. I’m a business psychologist if you would like more suggestions on how to truly rectify the matter.
2019-05-01 21:19:14+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support my Uber has been 8 minutes away for 8 minutes yet you’ll charge me if I cancel. Why is this a business model?
2019-05-01 21:18:48+00:00,I love the new @Uber_Support advert. Nothing screams desperation like a company charged with countless rapes that they need to tell people they’ve improved their safety features. #SaveOurBlackCabs #FuckUber

2019-04-25 21:04:14+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber #uberridepass is such a joke. They advertise that you won’t get surge or weather pricing and it will be a set rate well guess what? They #surge on the ride pass too.
2019-04-25 20:31:07+00:00,Don't waste money scheduling rides in advance. All that happens is Uber sends the closest driver 15 mins before the pickup time. They don't assign your ride to a driver up front. They are charging you extra just so you don't need to request the ride when you actually need it

2019-04-24 05:53:10+00:00,127 hours is a good movie but also it's how long @Uber and @Uber_Support have been making me wait to get paid for the one ride I gave last week. There needs to be a way to hold these companies accountable for literally not paying drivers. Forget about underpaying us.
2019-04-24 05:00:17+00:00,This is going to end with someone at @Uber_support telling me to be patient and wait 48 hours for the payment to process. That is what I got told on the phone 2 times now. It has been 120 hours. 
2019-04-23 23:20:47+00:00,Thinking out loud: What if every @lyft &amp; @Uber driver was sent a text at the start of each shift with photos of people/animals that had recently gone missing?

2019-04-21 23:56:52+00:00,My ride costed $40 and I spent the 25 min car ride wondering if I’d even make it home safe. Your response is to make sure I’m not matched with him again. It isn’t about me... it is about every other women who will get him as a driver. DO BETTER. @Uber_Support 
2019-04-21 21:54:33+00:00,You still did not provide me with any help nor gave me contact information for the rider! You leave me with no choice but to report this to the police! Very upset at the lack of help from you guys very unprofessional!

2019-04-21 10:34:30+00:00,@Uber_Support you haven’t answered the question. Drivers surely can’t accept a new trip if they’re currently on a trip? I couldn’t get home from the airport recently because 10 Uber drivers cancelled after accepting the job. Not acceptable.
2019-04-21 06:07:31+00:00,"Slightly ridiculous don’t you think @Uber_Support @Uber? Driver tells me he’s 15 mins away. 10 mins later he’s 21 mins away.. and now, another 15 mins later, he cancels. #uber #mumbai"
2019-04-21 05:58:13+00:00,This driver cancelled my trip coz I was not paying him in cash. Dear @Uber @Uber_Support you people need to show some professionalism n it's high time you'll start behaving in the right way n learn some basic sense. Idiot heads.

2019-04-21 00:16:02+00:00,I think @lyft values their drivers much more than @Uber. Lyft Support listens and genuinely tries to help. Contacting @Uber_Support is like talking to robots. They don’t listen and only give scripted answers.

2019-04-20 13:10:29+00:00,Without a phone you can’t receive the SMS code to an account. We simply asked you for access into the account so we can personally message the driver since y’all are so incapable. Y’all can throw your entire support team away. They seem pretty useless @Uber_Support

2019-04-19 18:43:29+00:00,Has anyone else noticed the increasing issue of Ubers purposely driving AWAY from you to get the cancelation fee? Sometimes I just take a taxi and see how long until they cancel. Weird @Uber_Support #uber #scam

2019-04-16 17:22:48+00:00,Perhaps Uber has nothing to respond to - but the LEAST they can do (and should do) is to tender an apology for your ordeal. Your ordeal is NOT isolated. SIMILAR experience is being highlighted in SM quite frequently. Hence -those ppl (agencies/their own HR) MIGHT be involved.
2019-04-16 16:42:36+00:00,Can we have a response from Über ? Also - it would be a good idea for Über to introspect and review their entire Selection process. This is to ensure that there is no “mole” or “black box” in their recruitment process/agencies who are having a Different Agenda altogether.

2019-04-15 03:57:09+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber_India @UberINSupport Can you guys take action against him because as I can see from last 2 3 months the way the drivers are behaving is really not bearable
2019-04-15 03:43:11+00:00,Looks like @Uber @Uber_Support have hired Jihadi drivers for campaigning against Modi Ji.
2019-04-15 03:38:35+00:00,@Uber_Support now comes the best part- when I was getting down his car he said “Modi ko bolo gaadi bhejega” and that’s when I realised my phone cover had Modi’s pic and I was talking on my phone when I first stepped into the car... I need to know your solution ASAP
2019-04-15 03:36:21+00:00,"@Uber_Support and this, when my tone was cordial and polite. I even asked him if this is how he talks to every passenger.

2019-04-14 05:50:28+00:00,It’s a money-laundering scam w/apps— using ‘errors’ and app ‘glitches’ to cause cancellations and still charge you as a way to trap your payment. Read the Uber Eats TOS- they reserve the right to do whatever they want-just like the rides.

2019-04-12 17:45:54+00:00,"In fairness to @Uber, I misunderstood how the cancellation credit works. It is not a limited resource, so I didn’t lose anything. Bu, AI-driven @Uber_Support failed to catch my misunderstanding through four or five cycles and I ultimately #SolvedThisMyself"
2019-04-12 16:53:07+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support I hope you didn’t charge me for the two cancellations I had to make because of the driver not wanting to pick me up!!! 
2019-04-12 14:58:13+00:00,Wait @Uber_Support I get charged a cancellation fee because the driver couldn’t find me? That’s dumb wtf the driver cancelled on me and I have to pay?? I was standing in a massive well lit intersection
2019-04-12 13:11:26+00:00,"@DC_DFHV Good morning - this @Uber_Support driver pulled into the cycletrack (outside 1232 4th NE) for a pickup, stopping in front of me and my daughter, forcing us to fit between him and oncoming traffic in order to proceed to school. "
2019-04-12 08:01:00+00:00,It’s amazing how Uber functions in this country. Doesn’t bother much with people’s safety in spite of several complaints and several incidents. Would you be so kind to call me @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India. You are unleashing rogue drivers and playing with people’s safety.
2019-04-11 23:40:02+00:00,You can dispute the cancel charge in the app it usually gets refunded instantly
2019-04-11 23:16:25+00:00,"Currently four cars with @Uber_Support stickers hanging out in the bus only lane on Dearborn. 36, 22 and 151 buses have to work around this. And yet the @cta gets blamed for ridership problems instead of the car share morons."
2019-04-11 20:25:52+00:00,"@UberEats @Uber_Support just want to let everyone know that uber are thieving scum. CCTV footage of us clearly returning the incorrect food to the driver and they still refuse a refund. Nice work, see you at small claims. Not the first time they’ve been dodgy either. "
2019-04-11 19:36:12+00:00,@Uber_Support y’all seein this?
2019-04-11 18:56:41+00:00,Hey guys/gals isn't there an option for cash payment on uber eats? or is that only a @SkipTheDishes feature that you guys don't offer? @Uber_Support
2019-04-11 16:50:22+00:00,Ball is in your court. You can throw them out with your unlawful rules or work with drivers to create a better working environment
2019-04-11 16:49:01+00:00,If they can’t pay their auto lease and insurance than you will see them on streets protesting against @Uber_Philly abuse of power
2019-04-11 16:47:27+00:00,We have got 20 days before changes take effect and if that happens alot of drivers will loose access to Uberblack platform.
2019-04-11 15:26:41+00:00,** UPDATE: the only thing #Uber did was say that they will never again pair my friend and that driver together. No reprimands or compensation. This is unacceptable. @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-04-11 11:46:28+00:00,"You'll be glad to know that apart from ""taking down my details"" I have received no response from either company in the form of an actual solution. I'm honestly more amused than mad... But I'm still mad. @Uber_Support @gbkburgers"
2019-04-11 09:38:25+00:00,"@Uber_PKR @Uber @Uber_Support TODAY, is the worst day with Uber. Really don't had any idea that, they will blackmail my employee. Who was on their ride to visit an hospital. "

2019-04-11 04:27:37+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support drivers shouldn't be allowed to select my ride when they are 10+ minutes away from the airport and many other cars are in the area. #makemewait
2019-04-11 04:05:56+00:00,hi @Uber_Support would there be uber cars which provide car seats in washington DC? Thanks!
2019-04-11 01:58:40+00:00,i hate this so much
2019-04-10 23:51:37+00:00,Tell how @Uber_Support wanted me to walk across the bay bridge and on water to get home???? 
2019-04-10 22:34:38+00:00,I'm sorry but Uber NYC doesn't give a crap about drivers or passengers. This is the level of customer support from them when you try to ask them a simple question about driver incomes. / @joshmohrer
2019-04-10 22:33:31+00:00,hey @Uber @Uber_Support please give me my money back 
2019-04-10 18:17:28+00:00,@Uber_Support you guys need to address this instead of sending us the same automated email. this is ridiculous
2019-04-10 08:17:49+00:00,I report all unaccompanied minors and always collect my cancel fee. Unfortunately Uber rarely deactivates these accounts.
2019-04-10 01:16:49+00:00,"..i just had an uber driver really try to convert me to christianity, is this allowed? @Uber_Support @Uber"
2019-04-09 09:08:18+00:00,Please log a written complaint in nearest police station further action will be taken.
2019-04-09 08:44:01+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_India. Was harassed this morning by my cab driver. Got into the cab. Spoke loudly on loudspeaker and asked him to tone it down as I had calls to make. He then lifted his hands to hit me, and then abused me verbally and threatened to do something(1)"
2019-04-09 00:03:31+00:00,"@Uber_Support I was charged over $30 over several charges for what was supposed to be 1 $8 charge!!! Wtf!!! I know you do the holds but this is fucking ridiculous, pay it the fuck back immediately or don't fucking take them all. I don't have money to buy food now. Thanks Uber!!"
2019-04-08 22:34:42+00:00,Wanted to let @Uber and @Uber_Support know that my last passenger Brian from Granada Hills High School was under 18. He canceled the ride when I explained that it's illegal to pickup unaccompanied minors. Please remove his account from your passenger system.
2019-04-08 20:53:52+00:00,Yo @Uber_Support your eats driver just drove off with my order. We literally watched them drive by as it posted as “Delivered”. WTF I guess @HattieBs chicken is just THAT good 
2019-04-08 19:19:25+00:00,"Yup, submitted many reports to @Uber and @AskLyft about their drivers in bike lanes and have never seen any action taken. There needs to be a mechanism for the city to revoke a rideshare driver's ability to operate commercially, as there is with taxis."
2019-04-08 18:33:17+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support I WANT THIS TO BE SOLVED ASAP!!! UBER’S TERMS OF SERVICE AND FORUM DON’T MENTION ANY OF THIS AND THIS IS A FULL BREACH OF CONTRACT 
2019-04-08 18:06:49+00:00,"Faced major security issue today. Driver stopped ride in mid way, threatned, abused & asked for money. UBER support did nothing and at the end Delhi Police came to rescue me. Worst service @Uber @Uber_Support @narendramodi @DelhiPolice"
2019-04-08 18:02:33+00:00,"Learned about @Uber ""vomit fraud"" this morning! Received a surprise $150 charge for allegedly puking during our short (and 100% throw up free!) ride last night. Funny too how the driver's photo ""proof"" was taken in the daytime and with a different color interior. @Uber_Support"
2019-04-08 16:46:51+00:00, peace out Girl Scout... I’m with @Grubhub now

2019-04-08 14:02:44+00:00,"Still no word from @Uber_Support or @Uber_India on this. It seems like the initial tweet was just a front. I wonder how many other companies have this false sense of 'caring'? Don't worry Bowie, #Hyderabad cares, even if Uber doesn't..."
2019-04-08 13:08:44+00:00,"So I have GPS on my phone that I left in my Uber over the weekend. I reported a missing item and haven’t heard anything back, and it is MADDENING to track my phone all over Memphis, likely still in the dude’s car. @Uber_Support"
2019-04-08 00:19:08+00:00,Super frustrated and disappointed with my recent @Uber experience. I was charged an extra 26 dollars because my driver dropped me off at a different airport terminal. @Uber_Support thinks that difference justifies a 1.5X upcharge - what gives?!
2019-04-07 23:30:22+00:00,Man! @Uber drivers are some of the most reckless drivers I’ve ever witnessed. My girlfriend was almost ran into but luckily she is a good driver and prevented it. @Uber_Support we have his license plate if you would like the info.
2019-04-07 22:57:44+00:00,My @Uber driver canceled on me &amp; I got charged an inconvenience fee? When I was standing at the location the whole 8 minutes he took to get to me? Buggin. @Uber_Support
2019-04-07 15:59:28+00:00,"It was handled already, thank you. Though I must say that while this might be a rare case, I felt pretty helpless when you responded basically saying “too bad” without seemingly doing anything, like checking with the driver or just asking me more questions. $150 is no joke."
2019-04-07 15:50:51+00:00,"They responded with pictures of the vomit in the front seat saying “see we have proof you vomited”. I sat in the back. It was a couple, with the dude sitting in the front and the girl sitting next to me. Thankfully after I explained yet again they refunded the charge. "
2019-04-07 15:28:15+00:00,Oh cool. @Uber charged ME $150 for the OTHER customer who vomited in my UberPool. How the hell is that fair? You think I liked smelling that?? @Uber_Support

2019-04-07 00:01:33+00:00,"Ayo, @Uber @Uber_Support, what's the protocol when my driver randomly stops to get gas when I have to be somewhere at a specific time? That's a free ride, right? Help me out here"
2019-04-06 19:10:05+00:00,Glad you got your food this time though! Keep the other guys handy in case. Ive been loving @postmates. Communication for each order is spot on. They notify you every step of the way. They refund for problems easily. Im about 30 orders and I couldn't be happier.
2019-04-06 17:38:56+00:00,"You guys have her like $3, is that really how you handle serious allegations?"
2019-04-06 14:05:31+00:00,"Paul, my @Uber driver, wasn’t moving after accepting my ride this morning. I politely messaged him asking to please start the ride, as I was late to work. This is what I got: @Uber_Support "
2019-04-06 11:03:31+00:00,Lexus ES 27214 @Uber @Uber_Support driver in #dubai! It is unacceptable that someone books a ride and thirty minutes later they are still waiting for you!

2019-04-06 05:43:29+00:00,"It's becoming a regular practice with @Uber. After waiting for 15 mins, the driver without notice just cancels the ride and do not answer calls later. Have to wait for another 15 min for another ride. Poor service becoming worse. I may soon switch to @Sajeecabs @Uber_Support"
2019-04-06 00:58:48+00:00,Hit you up. Is someone gonna get back to me? It’s very time sensitive.
2019-04-06 00:32:32+00:00,I am sure @Uber_Support would look into this 
2019-04-05 22:15:39+00:00,You can background check perverts. I had a guy that I thought was going to go full Ted Bundy on me. He started my ride of with a deep inhale and “mhm your perfume smells so good”
2019-04-05 20:53:55+00:00,Also the system doesn’t update automatically if the driver gets a car or rental. A few times I couldn’t find my Uber and the whole time the driver was in a rental car (car was in the shop).
2019-04-05 20:48:29+00:00,It happens ALL the time in New York. Especially since every other car is a black Toyota Camry.
2019-04-05 20:43:17+00:00,Excuse me @Uber_Support one of your employees literally dropped me off in the middle of nowhere after I told her to turn down the music in the car because it was too loud. I only got this 4 second video of her before she took off. So disappointed I want my refund now!! 
2019-04-05 18:00:29+00:00,Anybody else getting spammed by Uber right now??? It is still going on!!! It won’t stop @Uber @Uber_Support 
2019-04-05 17:40:07+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber_India I just got off an UberGo where my driver refused to switch on the AC and claimed it was official Uber policy to not use any AC for a hatchback. Is this for real? Just wanted confirmation before I take my business over to @Olacabs for the summer.
2019-04-05 16:59:03+00:00,"@Uber_Support hi I have no idea why this ride is showing as a £80 it was legit a 1.4 mile journey, good job it tried charging my old card! How do I have this fixed pls? I’m not paying £80 for a 7 minute journey unless it’s a helicopter "
2019-04-05 15:29:15+00:00,@Uber_Support @AskLyft Help protect drivers by requiring passengers to use and verify their real names. #WhatsMyName is important to protect riders AND drivers.
2019-04-05 13:49:17+00:00,Just your weekly reminder that you should use any other food delivery service other than @UberEats. Paid $12 and didn’t receive my order. @Uber legit stole $12 from me. Oh and @Uber_Support does nothing at all. #TheBrutalTruth #BrutalityOut
2019-04-05 03:19:56+00:00,Usually because they have screwed the driver about. Then the poor entitled possums wonder why their driver is less than impressed when delivering their order.
2019-04-05 02:45:04+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support and @AskLyft - Can you make a feature where if the person picking you up skeeves you out, you can cancel the ride and not have it immediately go to them when you recreate the ride?"
2019-04-04 22:12:14+00:00,Address him by king
2019-04-04 18:30:07+00:00,Hopefully the young man who was hit by one of your drivers will be doing that.
2019-04-04 15:37:14+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support You can't charge me waiting fees if my booking changes thrice and takes 5,4,7 minutes each time it is cancelled by your end. Pathetic service."

2019-04-04 13:01:20+00:00,There should be a penalty/charge of some sort if the driver cancels after a customer has waited a certain amount of time @Uber_Support because customers are charged if we cancel
2019-04-04 10:11:34+00:00,my Uber could have really killed me that night and all the company can do it refund my money. how helpful. @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-04-04 04:19:38+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats @Uber_India is this true? If so, I’ll stop using all your services for interfering in Indian elections"
2019-04-04 03:34:17+00:00,So I would like you to publicly acknowledge the issue and publicly state what changes will be made to ensure this nigh universal practice among your drivers stops
2019-04-04 03:33:05+00:00,"But to the public watching it looks like you’re doing something, that of course you won’t stand for the discrimination that happens constantly from your service Only to send gaslight and deflection to my private email and annoy me with app notifications"
2019-04-04 03:31:05+00:00,"Yet, I am sent a frankly offensive form email which fails to even acknowledge what actually happened much less that it is something that happens frequently This kind of “customer service” is predatory and manipulative"

2019-04-04 00:11:39+00:00,I believe you guys may have misinterpreted what I was saying..no issue over here!
2019-04-03 08:54:08+00:00,What a diagrace @uber @Uber_Support your driver charged a waiting fee because it took an 80 yr old passenger longer to get down the stairs..shame.
2019-04-03 08:42:12+00:00,.@Uber_Support @Uber_India why do you allocate drivers in NCR who need to pay for permit between Delhi and Gurgaon. This idiot has vanished for almost 15 mins to make permit payment and switched off the AC. Almost everytime you succeed in providing a pathetic experience in Delhi
2019-04-03 08:35:54+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India Request you take action immediately. I raised a complaint through Uber, but got no response. I am in the process of filing an FIR, but I am not sure about my safety, as the driver has threatened me and he knows my address."

I don’t know a single female friend who hasn’t been sexually harassed at least once by a driver working for you. What will you concretely do to ensure that this stops?
2019-04-01 15:14:51+00:00,Thats why i always call my favorite boda boda man mr ssalongo every time i want to travel. These mehn are loyal. The statement of deleting the ride from system is top influenced @Uber @Uber_Support . Or else we start flogging ur drivers. Tetwagara kamanyiro kamwe

2019-04-01 10:38:22+00:00,Greedy drivers? The ones averaging under minimum wage? Get a clue...Lyft and Uber practically forced drivers to accept these trips while finishing so driver can be robbed of surge pay and they can sneak in low rated paxholes

2019-04-01 05:17:52+00:00,The most annoying feature both @Uber &amp; @lyft have is allowing greedy drivers to accept rides when they haven’t yet completed the 1 they’re on. Let other drivers eat man! Holding the rest of us up! @Uber_Support @AskLyft
2019-04-01 04:37:31+00:00,Doesn't beat the time when my DoorDash driver just took my food to his house and ate it
2019-04-01 04:03:35+00:00,"I remember thinking I could relay on UberEats one time to make sure I would have food for the day, but the driver just gave me a bag of poop after 2 days"
2019-04-01 03:03:45+00:00,i feel the issue is more than just one missed turn...
2019-03-31 20:14:49+00:00,Thoroughly disappointed with the service I received from @Uber_Support @Uber
2019-03-31 17:45:15+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber .. we’re charged when cancelling our trips...but are your drivers charged when they cancel the trips and call to find out where you’re going -to decide if they want to drive there then cancel??????
2019-03-31 17:09:07+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support I will be deleting your apps (both Uber and UberEats) until you start treating your drivers with respect and pay fairly.
2019-03-31 16:48:11+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support what if you put bar code stickers on the window of every Uber? Before a fare got in they used your app to scan and confirm the car. Maybe the driver couldn’t start the ride until the code was scanned? #uber #SamanthaJosephson
2019-03-31 12:57:41+00:00,Are you looking for the missing woman’s details or the friend reporting? Because your response did not make sense
2019-03-31 12:20:25+00:00,Why are we not using and buying British products? You are letting an American multinational billion dollar company exploit British workers on less than minimum wage. They avoid tax which hurts our public services and that is why the country is in a mess! Oh and you lost a case!
2019-03-31 11:34:28+00:00,He was not the Uber Driver. He pretended to be one. Ride-sharing is really dangerous. We grew up to not talk to strangers and do not enter cars with people we don’t know. In 2019 everyone just hops into to cars with complete strangers.
2019-03-31 07:22:18+00:00,Who runs Uber’s twitter and why are they still employed lmaoooo
2019-03-31 01:32:03+00:00,i’m no snitch
2019-03-30 20:57:54+00:00,please bring Uber Sex to my area @Uber @UberEats @Uber_Support @UberFacts

2019-03-30 18:52:11+00:00,@ultra WTF was that ... worst night of my life. #Ultra2019 @Uber_Support surcharges through the roof after a 1.5 hour walk over a highway ... DANGEROUS! And my @AppleSupport #iPhone was stolen!
2019-03-30 18:06:39+00:00,So sad about this Samantha Josephson news. It would be super easy for both @Uber and @lyft to generate a unique 2D Barcode on the driver's phone that must be scanned by the passenger's phone to ensure it is their driver. SUPER easy. @Uber_Support @AskLyft
2019-03-30 15:26:36+00:00,Huge thanks to @Hayley_Savage_ and the team at @Enterprise Nottingham for helping out when I left my phone in an @Uber yesterday and thanks to Ashfaq the @Uber driver for handing it in to them for safe keeping @Uber_Support @TomHinto @JaneneScurfiel1
2019-03-30 09:02:15+00:00,I DM’d you & you literally just said we encourage you to work with our in app support team but I’m putting you on blast here b/c they wouldn’t. Is this how your company deals with issues? @Uber doesn’t care about the safety of its passengers or other drivers but can you try?
2019-03-30 03:32:35+00:00,"... so I then said “oh, well we are gay” - referring to me and a guy with me, and I said “do you have a problem with us? And he said “nah”... and didn’t know where to look. Annoyed I didn’t make a big deal out of it. @Uber @Uber_Support"
2019-03-30 03:31:56+00:00,Pretty sure my @Uber driver is driving in circles to get me to cancel and collect a fee. It’s been 20 minutes and he has zig zagged across three avenues and ten blocks. @Uber_Support
2019-03-30 03:31:03+00:00,"So my @Uber_Support @Uber home just now sneered at a male gay couple beside where he picked us up. I said “pardon?” and he confirmed what I thought I heard. “Gays”... I said “oh what about them?” And he said “naaaah”. I said “you don’t like gays, no?” and he said “nah”."
2019-03-30 02:23:08+00:00,We good fam
2019-03-29 21:36:00+00:00,@Uber @UberFacts @Uber_Support @UberMedia Please Don't launch an IPO... Launch an STO and attract your audience ... this can help https://weown.com/blog/considering-an-sto-download-our-new-ebook/
2019-03-29 20:29:25+00:00,You can get it refunded by going to your past trips and choosing the option that shows your issue. Report him.
2019-03-29 20:27:20+00:00,"I literally just had to cancel one and pay the fee to @Uber because our driver was ignoring us and sounded like he was stoned out of his mind, couldn’t hold a conversation. Made me super uncomfortable."
2019-03-29 19:53:53+00:00,Mcdonalds has this type of system. They put 2-3 seal stickers on the bag. I’m not sure why this is not an industry standard across all restaurants that delivery through 3rd party.
2019-03-29 18:10:46+00:00,@UberEats @Uber @Uber_Support y’all need to create a package that the restaurant touches LAST. Some sort of “void of broken”. A Sealed container. Something. I’ve been tweeting this.
2019-03-29 15:10:08+00:00,Sounds like YOU were irresponsible and YOU left an item behind. If you leave your phone in a restaurant did they steal it? #paxhole
2019-03-29 00:40:40+00:00,And I lost count how many homophobic drivers will cancel as soon as they see I’m going to the lgbt center or HRC. @Uber_Support. I have gotten into the habit of screenshoting as soon as I get a driver because they cancel so often and aren’t held accountable
2019-03-29 00:38:34+00:00,This driver got lost - made me wait - then canceled on me- @Uber_Support needs a way to report these. It’s such a fucking hassle to have to wait for another driver pic.twitter.com/QbauawUfL0
2019-03-28 19:39:17+00:00,Everyone watch your @Uber and especially @UberEats accounts because they are double charging people and @Uber_Support ISN’T RESOLVING THE ISSUE !

2019-03-28 15:33:16+00:00,"@Uber_Support Help! The directions Uber drivers are getting to access my business, a hotel, are wrong and creating a ton of frustration for our customers and your drivers. How can we get them changed/updated?"
2019-03-28 14:53:22+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support my driver made a wrong turn and then said he was “stuck in traffic and will be late” while on this lonely suburban street - then showed up with a Starbucks cup. He could have at least offered to get me something 
2019-03-28 12:27:16+00:00,Thank you @Uber @Uber_Support for your terrible service and thank you @lyft @AskLyft for never responding. I think I’ll walk next time.
2019-03-28 09:08:35+00:00,"@Uber_Support is terrible! They refused to refund me money, due to ""multiple requests for refunds"", and I was wondering if there's a limit of times they expect their drivers to steal from you . After this, I completely switched to @LittleRideKE"
2019-03-28 08:02:55+00:00,Is it me or does it seem like @Uber is paying us drivers less now. Why! @Uber_Support Think ima try @lyft @AskLyft #UberDriver #UberEATS #Lyft
2019-03-28 07:19:45+00:00,"Hey @Uber , see this driver? Just ordered him at Melb Airport. He phoned me right away to make sure I was in the pick up area (I was). Then asked where I was going.

I don't usually mind but tonight I had heavy groceries &amp; had to walk. Driver insisted he was at drop off. @uber @universalhub
2019-03-28 03:42:07+00:00,"Hey, @Uber_Support are you guys still alive at all? I reached out to support several times and still have no solution to my problem. TBH, I experienced such a terrible feeling as a user for the first time ever... "

2019-03-27 21:03:32+00:00,"Seriously, wait out the timer then cancel for UNACCOMPANIED MINOR. Collect your cancel fee and file report for RIDER WAS RUDE and state that it was a minor."
2019-03-27 20:36:25+00:00,"When I get a request pickup at a high school, rarely it’s a teacher, but usually a minor. I pull up, lock the door, roll down passenger window, turn interior mirror/dashcam to open window, then ask if they are 18, if not I ask them to cancel, if they don’t then I do immediately!!"
2019-03-27 20:22:39+00:00,I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had minors request rides to their Middle and High Schools. Once had a 9 year old requesting a car unattended. I refuse them all and file report for minor using account.

2019-03-26 09:38:07+00:00,One has to ask why the Media...like @BBCPanorama or @BBCPolitics…are not all over this? Is it because so many BBC staff use Uber? Is it because they like to take advantage of cheap rides?

2019-03-26 02:22:44+00:00,@Uber_Support #Uber should be ashamed of itself for taking advantage of the situation on the #LIRR tonight and gouging prices for stranded commuters. #disgusting

2019-03-25 12:01:33+00:00,I believe Uber just tries to entice other non-regular users instead of keeping and treating their loyal users. Like men. I use Uber every day and never receive promos!
2019-03-25 06:09:12+00:00,"This wasn’t a technical issue with the app. 4 of us all had our apps out, trying to get a ride for our friend. It is a lack of accessible vechicles on your service that were the issue."
2019-03-25 01:39:22+00:00,"The ""trouble"" is that your company is incapable of operating without frequent violations of half the provisions in the vehicle code, but our weak regulatory apparatus is willing to let it pass."

2019-03-20 04:35:21+00:00,It’s all same. @ola_supports @Olacabs @bhash ola has not replied to my incident over Twitter nor email and no phone since December. They just send messages pay us. Nobody is interested in security. They just want money. Zero humanity or ethics
2019-03-20 00:33:58+00:00,I've already did. That's how I got this nice note for William
2019-03-19 22:53:31+00:00,So @Uber just issued me a partial refund... thank you @Uber_Support - much appreciated.
2019-03-19 22:11:59+00:00,"Every time I take @Uber I regret it. Today is no exception. Quoted $35, was charged $68 ($5 of that was tip). I got socked with time + distance, which was not quoted on the front end. Thanks a lot, Uber. Filed a complaint... @Uber_Support"

2019-03-19 19:30:05+00:00,For you to review my concern? I've sent in 2 support tickets regarding this order and have had 2 responses from you guys saying I'm not getting a refund
2019-03-19 19:22:23+00:00,Still no follow-up from @Uber_Support about the driver fraud... how much you wanna guess they’ll tell me they’re “working on it”?
2019-03-19 17:09:39+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support is this one of your drivers? At 9:15am I witnessed them swerve around a car (and nearly hit a pedestrian) at Oxford and University, blow through a crosswalk (nearly hitting 2 peds at Oxford and Center, and then drove through the red light at Oxford and Bancroft.

2019-03-19 14:38:10+00:00,Worst part is..Uber doesn't have an emergency contact number in India.. happened to us as well...hope you are okay..
2019-03-19 14:31:53+00:00,"@Uber_Support Taking this particular driver as reference, I'd like to know how do you ensure something like this does not happen again? Is he going to be let off with a warning? Or sacked? Or sensitised? What are the concrete steps you're taking to make your riders feel safe?"
2019-03-19 14:30:17+00:00,"This is serious. No response from @DelhiPolice @DelhiTrafficPol ? Don't hesitate in filing a police complaint. @Uber_Support Do you not verify drivers' credentials before hiring? @Uppolice and @uptrafficpolice also need to look into the matter, since the car has no. plate of UP"

2019-03-19 02:09:07+00:00,Reasons why @Uber_Support @Uber realllllly annoys me. 1. They disable your account without informing you 2. They require you to explain your last 3 trips when you have no access to viewing your last three trips... cuz you can’t view them if your accounts disabled. Time4 @lyft ?
2019-03-19 02:07:24+00:00,hey @Uber @Uber_Support why is my account disabled???? 
2019-03-18 21:30:32+00:00,An Uber in Portugal is literally extorting me to get my wallet back from his car when I accidentally left in there on Saturday. @Uber_Support @Uber I’m ready to go back to America fr it’s always something in this country

2019-03-17 08:48:29+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support please fix this!
2019-03-17 08:03:54+00:00,@Uber_Support This is outrageous. Man I know that the Uber office is the new circle of hell but I had no idea that wheelchair users were being charged triple fares. Yikes! #ADA
2019-03-17 03:59:42+00:00,"...and by not taking Uber, you are saving yourself a ton of drama because so many scams going on... you'll eventually be a victim if you take them long enough."
2019-03-17 03:46:32+00:00,"Bcoz Uber CAN. Every abusive racket and fraudulent scams Uber are pulling in the UK now are all tried and tested in the US. They won’t change as long as u keep using them. U may as well use a real Black Cab, it’s cheaper."
2019-03-17 02:10:42+00:00,++ #UberChennaiAtrocities Driver sent will invariably will be different from the profile flashed by @Uber_Support. Book @Uber_Chennai only if you do not want to catch your flight/train.

2019-03-17 00:21:56+00:00,Don’t ride @Uber take a @lyft instead. They charge erroneous toll fees that never actually happened and refuse to refund the money! @Uber_Support does nothing but send you back into the scam wheel of programmed responses!!
2019-03-16 23:31:27+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support @Uber can you explain how we’ve been charged almost £300 for a 4 minute journey?
2019-03-16 18:41:13+00:00,"I have yet to hear from anyone resolving this issue. In the meantime, I’ve been sent the attached article. It seems I am a victim of fraud by an @Uber driver and will be filing a report with the police."
2019-03-16 17:52:18+00:00,"I don't disagree that it would be nice to have the full video and context, but nothing will change the fact that the reaction was overboard."
2019-03-16 17:05:02+00:00,"Fair enough. Let's say that is what happened -- the cyclist ""scratched his car."" Is the proper recourse for the driver to leave their vehicle, chase after the cyclist, berate them and then kick their bike while it's moving?"

2019-03-16 12:05:53+00:00,At least you saved £3 on the fare
2019-03-16 08:27:53+00:00,"Try a licensed black cab when in London, enhanced DBS checks, advanced driving test, fully insured, knowledgable driver, if you're out of London then a local licensed Hackney cab."

2019-03-16 05:56:59+00:00,I would like to see @FallonTonight read the @Uber_Support timeline of complaints on the show. Some of them are funny like how UberEats doesn't have a ck off item for hot sauce and the guys can't enjoy his fries now.
2019-03-16 00:28:29+00:00,It's getting past that point. I got out of a (obviously not @uber) minicab today shaking and crying in fear. You have given me no explanation about your total failure to look after my safety. When can I start to feel safe again?!
2019-03-16 00:22:17+00:00,"Definitely report that to @Uber @Uber_Support . Even outside of the red flags for safety concerns, your texts would basically be proof of the driver attempting to steal from Uber by trying to operate under the table. Easy disciplinary action"
2019-03-15 21:42:42+00:00,"I'm aware of the options. What I don't get is how Uber, a multimillion rideshare service doesn't have an algorithm to teach the app to have me walk to a different area so I don't have to watch a vehicle drive in circles on a map AROUND ME to pickup others. How is that efficient?!"
2019-03-15 17:16:54+00:00,"Because you can’t have dirt cheap & quality, it doesn’t work!"

2019-03-15 08:07:27+00:00,@Uber_Support this is now business day 5 since you charged me £83 for a journey where your partner driver nearly killed my friend and I and my money is still not back in my account. Your help section in the app is ignoring me can you please look into this ASAP?
2019-03-15 05:35:20+00:00,Waited 12 mins for a uber and they cancelled on me. Please make uber driver responsible for a fee like you make us do. @Uber_Support
2019-03-14 13:38:40+00:00,What a genuinely sadistic man you are sir.
2019-03-14 05:30:06+00:00,.@Uber_Support @Uber What’s up with your drivers?!? Accept a ride. Then they call and ask where you’re going. Then argue about the city. Then they cancel because it’s not an hour drive. Look at my trip history. I’m really upset and tired. DM me. #TERRIBLE #service
2019-03-14 05:09:25+00:00,Can't change my @Uber profile picture so I reached out to @Uber_Support. Turns out I need to go to a physical office in the suburbs to make this happen. Is this really 2019? #uberipo
2019-03-14 02:36:07+00:00,I really wouldn’t put it past TFL to allow Uber to be exempt from CC but charge the rest It is a simple case of if Uber don’t like it TFL gladly change it for them! They genuinely worship Uber &amp; will do whatever it takes to make sure they stay at all costs 
2019-03-14 02:17:33+00:00,#uber will increase fares to cover the cost .... they’ll make 25% and blame #TFHell and say it’ll make fares cheaper with less traffic . Traffic light already been phased so you catch more red lights so that’ll be easily sorted . Conspiracy or been here before ?
2019-03-14 01:53:28+00:00,"The only support I would like is a £5 toll charge added to every trip that goes inside the CC /Ulez, to run 24/7. This would bring PH fares to a 2019 level."

2019-03-13 19:06:28+00:00,Yeah definitely should have used Lyft. I'm just really appalled at how not serious they took such a huge safety issue.
2019-03-13 18:51:22+00:00,"Lol so my @Uber @Uber_NYC @Uber_Support driver put my life in danger twice yesterday and they decided to give me a $5 dollar credit. He tried to accelerate rapidly as my door was WIDE open both when I was trying to get in and out of the car. Guess everyone is right, use @lyft"
2019-03-13 10:33:43+00:00,Looks like @UberEats @Uber_Support isn’t in touch with their millennial segment. Retaining loyal customers is no longer based on individual experiences. Reviews are everything. Say goodbye to ~10 customers!
2019-03-13 08:57:12+00:00,DRAG THEM! @Uber make this right!
2019-03-13 03:58:16+00:00,The $15.03 uber is actually AFTER a 30% off meanwhile The $10.65 is without a 30% off. FROM AND TO SAME DESTINATION @Uber_Support @Uber I will be suing for FRAUD THEFT LIES AND EMOTIONAL DAMAGES SOON
2019-03-13 01:33:05+00:00,"Okay, this is really the stupidest thing I have ever heard. @uber, @uber_support, @dkhos. This is just really, I can't even. Do you want ANY good drivers to drive for you?"
2019-03-13 01:04:40+00:00,@ridesharepay @Uber_Support So 30% less for drivers who aren’t making minimum wage. So glad I walked away when I did. @Uber you are a freaking disgrace.
2019-03-12 23:18:20+00:00,Add a zero to how much you owe him for every hour it takes you to look into this.
2019-03-12 18:26:00+00:00,I'm wondering if your $20 order equates to the same amount of time (aka money) someone managing social for Uber Eats/Support is spending on reading these tweets. I wonder if they also know we wont stop until you get a refund?
2019-03-12 17:33:06+00:00,JUSTICE FOR CHRISTINA
2019-03-12 16:12:19+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support tell your drivers to STOP accepting rides when they’re still at home. It’s very annoying! Ppl have places to go
2019-03-12 10:25:22+00:00,Thanks guys - appreciate the response. But it's not about the money on this ride. Just disappointed the incremental moves towards mediocrity.

Sorry about your illness but if you think 16¢ per minute is worth waiting, you should have been in a mental hospital! seriously hope youre feeling better but this isnt your grad daddy's #Uber anymore!

2019-03-11 23:58:11+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I’m extremely unsatisfied with the inability to call a customer support agent.
2019-03-11 23:34:13+00:00,"BOTH companies lost LESS money when drivers were paid better, and when they didn’t get into every already established new tech gig-sector...

2019-03-11 23:27:05+00:00,"B/c ppl are quitting,, #Uber and #Lyft had it really good when they paid drivers more,, now the see more ppl wanting to drive and tire driver rates to shreds,, what they didn’t take into account is SO MANY new drivers quit within a week,, others not making what they thought,, etc"
2019-03-11 23:16:48+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support please refund my money. My order never arrived and now I’m being ghosted. No need to start trending!!
2019-03-11 22:35:20+00:00,"Maybe they should have a authentication system that the driver sends a code to your phone on getting close to picking you up. When you get to the driver your phone must have the same code as yours. @Uber @Uber_Support come on guys, we need to make this service safer."
2019-03-11 21:03:06+00:00,Having a never ending conversation with @Uber_Support. Painful and very frustrating.
2019-03-11 18:52:18+00:00,"Myself and my girlfriend, (who's uber account it was) have spent the whole of yesterday and today trying to resolve this. We have asked for a time stamp on the photos as further evidence which uber has failed to provide. Sort it out @Uber_Support @Uber"

2019-03-11 09:42:01+00:00,The same woman took me inside a dark room with 98 people inside because according to her I didn't believe in her. Then she took a golden statue out of her handbag and hit my head. I don’t remember anything else.

2019-03-11 07:05:42+00:00,"I wish there was a “I’m not local” or, “female and travelling alone” kind of flag which impacted review of driver if they cancel as it impacts your (passenger) safety. And drivers don’t know who has that flag so only know if they cancel one it’s an automatic 1 star review"
2019-03-11 05:46:31+00:00,They did that to me in Australia when I needed it to go to the airport plus lots of times been left in rain with cancelled drivers. It’s extremely annoying. I’ve now got multiple taxi apps on my phone because of this as I can’t trust Uber.
2019-03-10 23:32:09+00:00,Thanks @Uber_Support for fixing this so quicklyz 
2019-03-10 20:41:27+00:00,"@Uber_Support Please address this immediately, I had the same driver and he refused to wear a shirt with sleeves. He also refused to let me sit in the backseat because it was filled with bricks???"
2019-03-10 15:07:41+00:00,Well that was a waste of my time. Irritating to get a run around like they are going to help just to be referred back to the original refusal.
2019-03-10 12:30:20+00:00,"So the @Uber driver was driving like a maniac last night and when my brother asked the be let out, the guy did so, made a u-turn and then proceeded to drive over my brother. He us currently on life support in ICU. WTH is wrong with your drivers, @Uber_Support??"
2019-03-10 12:08:40+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I book a car and. Says 2min away and 10min later when I want to cancel as it still says 2min away and no car it says I will be charged for drivers time ?? What about my time ? And why must I pay if it’s taken 5x longer ?

2019-03-02 03:00:40+00:00,It occurs to me that they could close the food theft loophole by making drivers return undelivered food to the restaurant.
2019-03-02 02:52:48+00:00,"""Driver couldn't get to your address,"" is the excuse they're using. I'm still not sure how - even if it were true, which it's not - that would mean they can keep the money."

2019-03-01 02:31:26+00:00,I know all to well how hard it can be to eat when you can't even stand up. To depend on a delivery and get treated this way is horrible.
2019-03-01 02:28:11+00:00,Uber eats is doing this to disabled people? Shouldn't be doing this at all. For a disabled person that can't get to food this is beyond wrong.

2019-02-26 04:29:59+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support It’s not cool to leave your customer waiting for 20mins outside and then have the ride cancelled twice. I had to cancel the ride myself and charged for the cancellation fee because the third driver was too far away. Not a good experience. 
2019-02-25 23:27:52+00:00,The lack of support is just.. the stench

2019-02-25 03:08:21+00:00,Is your @Uber pool driver allowed to tell you where to sit? Mine just told me to not sit in the back (two people sitting in the middle/window seat) and get in the front seat @Uber_Support

2019-02-24 14:16:12+00:00,@Uber_Support @uber This is what you get when you pay drivers 2 cents a mile (60 cents - the 58 cents the government says costs to own a car). And that only includes miles with a pax in the car meaning we actually lose money in NJ
2019-02-24 13:58:57+00:00,I’ve direct messages you the full video liscence plate location and drop off address. @RoninZee has the phone number for the account.
2019-02-24 12:31:11+00:00,Ordered a share box (20) nuggets from @McDonaldsUK via @UberEats and they only gave me one sauce! 20 nuggets and only one sauce... can you imagine rationing one sauce for 20 nuggets? @Uber_Support

2019-02-24 04:53:38+00:00,love ordering a late night McDonald’s snack from @UberEats and when it arrives it’s drenched in Coca Cola dripping from the bag quality stuff @Uber_Support can’t wait to eat my coke flavoured fries 
2019-02-24 03:27:17+00:00,Never ordering for @UberEats again. Just spent over 2 HOURS trying to get a refund for a $75 accidental order which was cancelled TWO seconds after they had accepted the order. Customer service was absolutely atrocious. I feel like I’ve been stolen from. @Uber_Support
2019-02-24 02:27:07+00:00,@Uber_Support don't want to be this person but I still haven't actually heard back from anyone regarding this issue... It's been over 2 days 
2019-02-24 02:19:03+00:00,"Wow. Just had the worst customer experience with @Uber_Support. Incredibly unhelpful after my @UberEats order was returned by the driver AFTER she already picked it up, and then an @Uber rep called to explain it, &amp;hung up on me. Already had terrible opinions ab Uber + now... "
2019-02-23 21:58:32+00:00,The screen to car ratio here is crazy @Uber_Support

2019-02-23 01:51:56+00:00,Why won’t you let me join the fleet @uber ? @Uber_Support 
2019-02-22 17:58:51+00:00,Y’all better hope and pray you never need @Uber to be reliable. @Uber_Support has been the worst customer service experience of my life
2019-02-22 16:31:43+00:00,"See, it’s understandable a consumer would expect that an independent contractor driver would have control over price. That’s a reasonable expectation. The reality that we have zero control over price confirms we are actually employees."

2019-02-22 09:44:07+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber_UAE @Uber_Canada unfair dealing with uber drivers in Pakistan.....
2019-02-22 07:33:21+00:00,Drivers do not set or modify prices. That’s all 100% Uber. Drivers have no idea what they will make trip to trip. Only after ride is completed
2019-02-22 01:56:26+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_HYD What a looting technology does the Uber is using within fraction of seconds you can double the price, just scheduled a cab it shown some price once the trip was completed you have charged almost 120% more than the actual estimate."
2019-02-22 01:24:44+00:00,@Uber_Support your driver took off with the wrong person and I got charged...I don’t even understand how this can happen
2019-02-21 22:15:06+00:00,If I sent u my number will you send me his cheeseburger
2019-02-21 15:50:30+00:00,"Driver acted rationally given the fact that you pass 80% of the risk onto him. Don’t refund me, either make a market or get out of the commute segment. Don’t make me think you’ve created value while you’re in fact extracting value from your supply."
2019-02-21 13:59:46+00:00,Y’all gave me $3 off rides for 4 days after my info was stolen through YOUR system. And y’all saying you *now* can’t locate the charges. Unacceptable. Up to $12 off a ride is not reparations for almost $350 in charges. What the absolute fuck is wrong with y’all!?!
2019-02-21 13:46:02+00:00,@Uber_Support reply from Uber they are working on the query..... SHAME ON U GUYS..... @tejinderbagga @2019_support @KapilMishra_IND

2019-02-21 06:38:40+00:00,So explain this to me @Uber @Uber_BLR @Uber_Support @Uber_India A customer is charged a cancellation fee but when a driver cancels he isn’t charged a cancellation fee ? No wonder your drivers cancel on a whim. What sort of policy is that ?
2019-02-21 04:28:06+00:00,Is this the way the issue is solved?? Just refund the cancellation fee! If this was the situation if had happened at night? How can you let such drivers be part of ur brand! @Uber_BLR @Uber_Support @Uber_India
2019-02-21 04:22:22+00:00,bruv he's messing with ya
2019-02-20 22:10:38+00:00,Sorry everyone it was a joke - my father caught an Uber in Chile - so it’s in Pesos!
2019-02-20 21:32:53+00:00,"I've been monitoring social media and see this same dance played out time after time. Uber asks for info, client provides it, and nothing gets done. Your best course of action is to notify your credit card provider of the fraudulent charges then have them issue you a new card."
2019-02-20 19:12:32+00:00,Uber should offer major discounts to senior citizens 75 and older. It’s awful here in FL with snowbirds. Boss was just in a serious wreck with an 85yo still driving @Uber_Support

2019-02-20 02:02:29+00:00,@Uber_Support I need Help and there is no number to call! Cell phone left in car and driver does not pick up. Just got on highway. Who do I call?

2019-02-16 01:53:14+00:00,"@Uber_Support Can you justify your clean air fee please? I was picked up in a hybrid vehicle, why are you charging me an additional fee? Surely you should deduct this from drivers using non green vehicles instead of charging customers?"

2019-02-15 23:53:17+00:00,Getting help from Uber is like getting assistance from a wall. They NEVER have a number to speak to a real person. It’s all ‘enter your information and issue’ then you get help THROUGH EMAIL after 3 days.. it’s bullshit.
2019-02-15 23:52:59+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support this driver should be fired!!!! Stole my friends phone and wallet. 
2019-02-15 23:44:08+00:00,@14News Just wanted to give my local peeps a heads-up public service announcement...use caution when using Uber! Your credit card information is NOT safe. I’ve been charged numerous times over the last few months with fraudulent charges from Uber. They wont help @Uber_Support
2019-02-15 23:42:09+00:00,@Uber_Support MAKE THIS RIGHT
2019-02-15 14:20:38+00:00,"I didn't think customer support could ever be quite as bad as @uber @Uber_Support No one reads your issue, you get different agents sending back canned responses. Absolutely useless. @lyft please come to Edmonton"

2019-02-15 02:03:10+00:00,I am confusion. Is UberEats policy in NYC “curbside delivery”? Because the delivery person just said that and refused to deliver to the apt. @Uber_Support
2019-02-15 00:19:17+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support ...your driver called me to say he cannot pick me up...and you make me pay the $5.00 cancellation fee? I WANTED the ride. If anyone should be getting $5, it should be me."
2019-02-14 23:30:34+00:00,You lost a loyal customer @Uber_Support because Richard couldn’t be bothered to pick me up and cancelled the trip and stole $10 it was day time we could have worked it out.

2019-02-14 04:55:21+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support why are you changing the driver surge model so harshly. You’re taking a big chunk of income from most drivers, but still pocketing the multiplier yourself! Now we get $5 surge bonus instead of $20+ surge bonus on trips I previously would have? Saving 4 IPO?"

2019-02-13 13:18:24+00:00,It is mandatory for drivers to get police verification done prior to acceptance by the aggregator...but that doesn't ensure that proxy drivers do not drive these..Police should check these vehicles quite often...Neha's experience is quite scary and it be addressed immediately
2019-02-13 12:37:53+00:00,"Due to an @uber driver ripping me off of $30 before we even were able to get in a car, and an awful response from @Uber_Support, used The Curb app to book taxis in NYC this weekend. Was impressed all the way around. @nyctaxi have stepped up their game."
2019-02-13 12:00:39+00:00,"Happens all the time in Delhi. I have documentary evidence of me complaining twice about it. Then when I saw they did nothing (actually @Uber encourages this) I moved to Meru or I park my car at the airport. I pay a lot more, but it's safer."
2019-02-13 10:05:58+00:00,"Have stopped using @uber for similar reasons and it's been a month now. I've used Uber since its launch in India in 2013, but the customer service has gone from bad to worse. They never take passenger safety seriously."

2019-02-13 07:22:18+00:00,This has happened gazillion times with me. @Uber_Support @Uber_Delhi @Uber_India you are playing with fire. Not sure what the law is. Can Uber be booked for facilitating impersonation on its platform?
2019-02-13 06:59:15+00:00,No response or action by @Uber_India @Uber_Support @Uber_Delhi yet ! Worse... @DelhiPolice is yet to wake up.
2019-02-13 06:02:11+00:00,"I am glad you reached safe.

2019-02-13 03:36:55+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support I had a driver cancel on me because he didn’t think I was coming and then I got in the car and it was too late. He insisted on driving me for free since he cancelled on me and was so beyond nice I want to pay him for his time! Can someone help me?

2019-02-13 01:01:13+00:00,Had to go hard on them myself not long ago. A driver tried to kick me out from his vehicle for no reason on the freeway at night. Uber wouldn't even call me back or reply until they became aware I was serious like you are.
2019-02-13 00:53:35+00:00,I will wait until end of the evening for @Uber_Support @uber to send me the requested info on the details for the fraudulent charges that were charged to MY credit card before I escalate this.

2019-02-12 16:48:37+00:00,@Uber_Support Hi uber. What's the point of having a complaints procedure if when complaints are made you end up going back and forth between uber and restraunt with nothing resolved. DONT USE UBER unless you want to play takeaway roulette. Very poor customer service.
2019-02-12 16:32:25+00:00,@Uber_Support Do you have a point of contact for my attorney? I want to file a class action since you have decided to deny me my referral payment and provided a false reason for doing so. https://help.uber.com/partners/section/referrals-?nodeId=0263a5fe-b042-4dca-85b8-a6e3c543fa21 You stated that I can't get paid b/c my account was inactive.

2019-02-12 05:36:12+00:00,I would think that considering the amount of money @Uber makes they would have updated their app WITHOUT glitches by now. Do better @Uber_Support

2019-02-10 21:28:25+00:00,@Uber_Support you’re disputing method for cleaning fees is terrible. I’m not the first person who’s been victim of “cleaning fee fraud” $150 for water on a seat is a joke. Water that I did not spill! @lyft you have a new customer
2019-02-10 20:29:30+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support care to explain ?

2019-02-10 13:10:30+00:00,I was fined $150 from my hotel for violating the no smoking policy because my @UberEats order smelled SO much like cigarettes and customer service clearly doesn’t care. Does @BillyMcFarland of @FyreFestival run your operations? @Uber_Support @Seamless #UberScam
2019-02-10 11:34:00+00:00,Perfectly valid response. In our area of editorial interest - but can you kindly find an alternative to the c word please?
2019-02-10 11:27:44+00:00,Uber has consistently lowered rates for drivers so when prices surge they cancel a current pickup to get a more profitable ride. Blame Uber and not your driver.
2019-02-10 09:13:20+00:00,"Have a day off mate it’s Sunday tell them not to bother I’m off to bed, app deleted "
2019-02-10 08:41:30+00:00,That's what you get for not going out and getting it yourself.
2019-02-10 08:40:28+00:00,"Hey, I ordered several milkshakes and realized my address was set to a different country from before. I cancelled my order literally within 2 seconds and still got charged the full amount. Lady on the phone said it can't be refunded... Please help me @UberEats @Uber_Support"

2019-02-10 04:21:11+00:00,Extremely poor service. Lost my phone in the cab yesterday around 5pm. No response from @Uber_Support till now except hollow drafted replies. The driver's number is INVALID. No way to reach out. #NotWorththeTrust #PoorUberSupport #UberIndia #CustomerService
2019-02-10 01:14:14+00:00,A reply like this to a general statement shows how out of touch @Uber is with it's drivers.
2019-02-09 20:50:47+00:00,"When your @Uber_Support driver never shows up to your place and just drives off somewhere random and never cancels the ride so you have to pay to cancel. Jokes on you Vilas, I got a lyft ya cunt. I ain't giving you my $5 pic.twitter.com/PgwOs0oEIt"
2019-02-09 18:01:45+00:00,I have just mailed you the full story @Uber_Support. Please see to it and respond promptly.
2019-02-09 10:10:32+00:00,Fun? If you want a laugh go to a comedy club. If you want to get to the correct destination safely get a bc. The generalisation that bc drivers are rude is ignorant and disguises the fact you just want cheap. Remember when bc ate gone you’ll have no choice.
2019-02-08 21:27:41+00:00,"It’s been almost 2 days since I was assaulted by an Uber driver. It’s also been about that long since I’ve heard from @Uber_Support on it. Meanwhile, that driver is likely still free to pick up riders. @Uber, do you care about rider safety? Cuz this makes me think you don’t."
2019-02-08 15:56:44+00:00,"my @uber canceled on me twice this week alone, while running late on the way to the airport, is this fair? i was even charged a cancellation fee! is @Uber_Support punishing the driver? i barley missed the flight. i think i am ditching uber"
2019-02-08 13:15:30+00:00,"Hi @Uber_Support if a driver takes a job and then it says it’s 15 minutes away because he is on another job which is driving away from you, why can’t we cancel to get another cab which is closer and available without incurring a £5 charge?"

2019-02-07 23:26:45+00:00,Been down that road. Uber doesn’t help and gives lip service on social media. They use excuse after excuse to refuse to make things right
2019-02-07 23:09:11+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support 2 of your drivers just canceled on me in a row after asking me where I was going. Can I get a ride tonight or nah?

2019-02-07 17:01:19+00:00,. @Uber charged me a $28 cleaning fee... because I left salt stains in the car... Because it’s winter... in CANADA... the first Uber I jump into this morning looks like this. And now my 2nd best pair of velvet pants are ruined. Thanks @Uber_Support #FeelingSalty
2019-02-07 15:55:28+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support Why are you charging me wait times when drivers arrive across the street from actual pickup address requested? It's winter, there are snowbanks to negotiate and I use a mobility aid. I shouldn't be penalized and you shouldn't be asking me to cross the street."
2019-02-07 12:32:39+00:00,It’s absolutely ridiculous Uber charges you to cancel a ride that says it will arrive in 5 minutes but the driver hasn’t moved from their spot in over 10.... your app sucks #bemorelikelyft @Uber @Uber_Support
2019-02-07 06:38:17+00:00,Uber do not respect the law... can only operate in a corrupt society like London...
2019-02-07 06:19:18+00:00,"I have come to the realization that @Uber_Support 's ""technical support"" is not actually run by humans but by a very poorly programmed Artificial Intelligence program.

2019-02-06 22:24:16+00:00,Report them! @Uber_Support They'll get banned from the platform. That's completely unacceptable.

2019-02-06 17:25:21+00:00,You need to know that you are so lucky. If taxi drivers catch you before police... I cant say more :(
2019-02-06 17:21:45+00:00,"Because Uber’s mantra is ‘don’t ask permission, beg forgiveness’ - they break rules/ignore laws/regulations worldwide."

2019-02-06 02:51:01+00:00,I’ve always served my riders well and I really enjoyed driving for Uber. wish it didn’t have to be like this @Uber @Uber_Support 
2019-02-06 02:40:36+00:00,Why does Uber lie? They always put an eta that’s 20 mins off. Like I could have paid $3 and taken the subway and arrived faster. And the stupid walk to your car option. Like whyyyy am I taking a car - because I don’t want to walk @Uber @Uber_NYC @Uber_Support

2019-02-05 17:09:38+00:00,@Uber it’s literally every female who uses your platform has to heal with the harassmentfrom your male drivers. I’ve had a few get MAD that i had headphones in to. Or talk to them. SCREEN YOUR DRIVERS NOT GIRLS. I’ll be using @lyft from now on
2019-02-05 16:41:12+00:00,Uber’s responses are so robotic! 
2019-02-05 11:50:46+00:00,Seems a little late to be enthusiastic about resolving a customer complaint that you could’ve resolved in the first instance. I teach customer experience to businesses and this experience is a fail. Be better.

2019-02-04 15:46:53+00:00,Anyone else notice @Uber’s newish “wait time”? Drivers can start rides when they choose even if they haven’t arrived/are in wrong spot resulting in hidden fees. I’ve noticed many “wait time” charges when I’ve been the one waiting. How can this be more transparent @Uber_Support?

2019-02-02 17:03:02+00:00,So @Uber_Support is either getting more like a drill sergeant or more like a good buddy and just calling me by my last name now (and still not addressing what happened)

2019-02-01 14:08:45+00:00,@Uber_Support My food never showed up last night and your customer service claims the driver waited for me for 30 mins although he never rang my doorbell or contacted me. Tracking map showed him nowhere near my house. Total scam

2019-02-01 13:43:32+00:00,@Uber_Support your reserve a ride function is an absolute JOKE. My driver was scheduled to be 18 minutes late from when you told me he would be there. THEN he was still 15 minutes away 18 minutes later... you can refund my parking fees from the airport
2019-02-01 08:27:07+00:00,"Really? .you know a month ago i requested he accepted and did not move an inch after 5 min he started driving towards pick up point, he came just close to it.. a few secs he cancelled ..did not even see the guy..was charged R25 ..went staright to help on app and i was refunded"
2019-02-01 08:01:55+00:00,They come accept take long then without coming to your destination say arrived wait few minutes cancel then you charged ...I know what I am tlking abt..As much the app system is superb but that error must be rectified.

2019-01-25 13:08:14+00:00,"This is why Uber needs to be regulated exactly like taxis, so this doesn't happen. Until then, never use Uber. And no, Uber Support doesn't take this ""very seriously""."

2019-01-20 19:36:29+00:00,"LMAO @UberEats you’re pathetic. A driver can’t follow simple instructions or google maps to deliver the food, so they just steal it? And then @Uber_Support has the audacity to blame the customer even after we’ve tried to contact the driver multiple times?!"
2019-01-20 13:51:43+00:00,I’m not going to put the driver. It doesn’t matter how bad the drivers (or their cars) smell - unless a driver is rude or dangerous; they’re always getting 5 stars (Im not costing anyone their job) This is a platform problem.

2019-01-19 17:52:38+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support I am so disappointed with the service I am receiving on your Uber eats app. After the app failed this morning and said the order didn’t go through we ordered on a different account. Without even notifying us the order did go through and we had no idea until it(1)
2019-01-19 17:20:14+00:00,"@Uber_Support I just had food delivered, but want to tip the guy more. How can I do this? Somehow a $4 tip was already added."
2019-01-19 15:07:09+00:00,"I find it amazing that a person requests an Uber, usually 3-5 minutes away, then once the driver arrives, that person has another two minutes of free wait time, then after that, Uber starts to charge PEANUTS for wait time, and then Mr. entitled has THE NERVE to complain about it."
2019-01-19 12:36:13+00:00,"Firstly you’re son never got a TAXI at all he got a PHV if he had got a TAXI he would of been 100% safe , if you’re choosing to use Uber because it’s cheap you have to accept the many risks that go with it"
2019-01-19 09:54:14+00:00,. @Uber_Support my uber driver saw me listening to music with wired headphones and proceeded to shove me out of the car onto the pavement screaming ‘I DONT ASSOCIATE WITH BROKE’ before speeding off. this is him 
2019-01-19 07:48:46+00:00,Send him to my house and I will take care of the problem 
2019-01-19 07:43:56+00:00,I thought my uber driver was literally kidnapping and uber credited me $5 to solve my issue. HE TOOK ME OVER A BRIDGE INTO THE BRONX and when i said he was going the wrong way he SHRUGGED. I literally cried until i got home. @Uber_Support thinks 5 bucks can fix the issue. Wtf.
2019-01-19 01:24:56+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support, your services have become to poor that I cannot recommend to use Uber anymore. You really need to work on some background verification when you provide partnership to a driver. Being a male, I cannot feel safe at times so forget about female travelers."
2019-01-19 00:59:43+00:00,"@Uber_Support WOW, what a quick response!!! very impressive. i managed to file for the refund through the app and i think my account was already credited! Thank you very much for your help!"
2019-01-18 21:40:30+00:00,"Thankfully, @AnthonysCFPizza provided great customer service. They couldn't believe only half the sandwich was there and said don't eat it because it's been tampered with. Entire order was replaced quickly and picked up. Ironically, @Uber_Support would only refund half my money"
2019-01-18 20:37:40+00:00,This is because IPO is supposedly soon they have to show liquid cash and show profitability or at least less loss than 1.2 billion last quarter so that fools gold look appetizing to public my prediction in 90 days after IPO they go bankrupt.

2019-01-17 22:56:49+00:00,Dear @Uber - in what world is a compact Hyundai Suv that can hold 4 passengers max “XL”? Thanks for wasting everyone’s time. I’m not paying the cancellation fee. @Uber_Support

2019-01-17 20:09:03+00:00,How about a public explanation of how the offer is supposed to work instead.
2019-01-17 19:52:02+00:00,How can Uber even prove it was him? What if he took a Lyft trip after? I had no idea that Uber could do this and I will def reconsider the next time I am booking a ride

2019-01-17 17:12:20+00:00,How about getting your phone hacked by your Uber driver? Its happening... Uber has a serious hacking problem and they need to shut down and clean it up. Everyone is in danger. Brandon Glover (Uber hacker) has really done a number on Uber and its time for everyone to wake up.
2019-01-17 15:41:22+00:00,Honestly fuck @UberEats and @Uber_Support they both suck!
2019-01-17 15:38:24+00:00,"Also they should implement ""Secret Drivers"" like the whole secret shopper thing so they have another way to deal with quality assurance in their services. @Uber_Support I'm giving you this idea for free. Pls use it."

2019-01-14 17:56:14+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber_Kolkata this is very disappointing that it is not safe to travel with your drivers. How can your driver threaten to stop the ride in between and that too for female passengers at 11 pm at night? And even asked for extra cash. PURE HARASSMENT .

2019-01-08 18:42:21+00:00,There is no excuse. If he didn't want to wait he could have rejected the trip and left. There is no excuse for this kind of behavior.
2019-01-08 15:42:27+00:00,You need to check your drivers. I was personally attacked by one of your drivers for being muslim and not covering up - he went as far as yelling “you should be ashamed of yourself” and getting out of his car to try and hit me. I had to run in a shop at night to protect myself.
2019-01-08 15:37:38+00:00,"Dear @Uber_Support, I’ve been overcharged 10£ while in the ; instead of a reimbursement, you gave me credit. Fine. But now, according to your agents, I can’t use this credit in , where I live? I will be more than happy to go back in the UK, just send me the plane ticket "
2019-01-08 15:37:28+00:00,"How can you even say this, how do u even call people names,the screenshot is self explanatory .. if you cant wait then cancel the trip.."

2019-01-08 09:19:46+00:00,"No matter how long she made him wait he had no reason whatsoever to call her all that. If i was in his shoes I'd be extremely mad but would never depend so low to calling a lady a prostitute; maybe he's one too. Meanwhile, let's wait for ""CEO's"" response "
2019-01-08 08:42:29+00:00,"Isn’t that why uber is meant to do like some form of training for its riders ? Know how long you should wait or call before cancelling the trip ? Absolutely, but nothing warrants such a response. Not when you’re representing someone else that’s not you."
2019-01-08 08:31:49+00:00,Everyone is frustrated doesn’t mean you use your frustration to drag someone else’s business through the mud. He’s a customer service provider for uber. He should take out his frustration by cancelling the trip and the customer will be charged. And laying a complain to uber.
2019-01-08 08:17:02+00:00,What happened to ending the trip and reporting the customer? Engage your brain Mr. Man!
2019-01-08 08:09:13+00:00,This one is school dropout reasoning from no direction.
2019-01-08 08:02:21+00:00,You clearly are...with all this mental gymnastics you are doing here. No action/inaction from the customer should justify this sort of reaction if you want to be honest with yourself. Your trying to justify those words says a lot about you.
2019-01-08 07:52:33+00:00,i check to see if i was following u so that i could unfollow. you don’t have sense. thank you

2019-01-08 07:25:28+00:00,"Nah! That man deserves to be proper punished. All that insult because of what? Even if she’s what he said, he has no right. None whatsoever!"
2019-01-08 06:48:47+00:00,"Even if he started waiting since 2000 years ago, that doesn't give him the right to insult her. Even if he saw them fucking and he is waiting outside, he wouldn't still have called her names or assume it's her sugar daddy..... He went overboard and should be penalised"
2019-01-08 06:32:42+00:00,If he couldn't wait all he had to do cancel and the customer would be charged 400naira not all this name calling. Nothing justifies this name calling. Nothing at all.
2019-01-08 06:22:02+00:00,"Even if he waited for 10hours, there are more polite ways to address such issues than calling her a prostitute. He was wrong on all levels. Did you read the message atall? If yes, now imagine if it was your sister or girlfriend or better still wife. Would you stil give this reply"
2019-01-08 06:20:17+00:00,Are you insane?????
2019-01-08 05:58:08+00:00,That someone can defend that message by the driver is even more shocking. Who raises these people to think it's ok to insult people at will?

How many miles a driver drove is relevant to their expenses since Uber isn’t reimbursing drivers for that? @Uber_Support-???"
2019-01-06 22:21:14+00:00,Ya I responded. You’re a failure at customer service.
2019-01-06 22:16:17+00:00,Here is the last few days. Still waiting.

2019-01-06 13:16:49+00:00,Snober don't get into this trap. At the end Uber will respond 'we are unable to trace your account with the given email. That's what they always did with me
2019-01-06 09:46:24+00:00,@Uber_Support @UberEats @Uber @timesofindia @BBCBreaking What the hell is wrong with you Uber? Why do you keep asking the same question even after giving my order details? Twitter should probably ban Uber's account.
2019-01-06 06:39:26+00:00,"Extremely rude driver who was so unsafe to travel with that I chose not to go on the trip with him. @Uber_Support @Uber its my fault that I haven’t learn from so many such experiences in the past. Even after such unfortunate tragedy once , u have also not learnt anything"
2019-01-06 05:03:19+00:00,"Hello @Uber_India @Uber_Support, you need to resolve the issue ASAP at Vizag Airport. Unavailability of uber cabs at arrivals bay is a real pain. You need to find a resolution ASAP."
2019-01-06 04:08:29+00:00,@Uber_Support I'm locked out of my account for the second time in three days. In the last 72 hours I've only been able to go online for about three hours. My account is in good standing. Why is this happening?
2019-01-05 23:21:50+00:00,"I went through six emails with your “support team” when it happened. I’m good. I appreciate your response here, but I have done the email thing."

2019-01-05 11:23:36+00:00,@Uber @rustybroo @Uber_Support @UberUKsupport More evidence your drivers are dangerous &amp; aggressive. Needless to say you are useless at Safe Guarding

2019-01-05 03:07:25+00:00,"So, I called the @Uber driver to ask which side of the street he was on. He yelled at me, hung up, and canceled my trip. Please, try to hire people who are not as angry as he is! @Uber_Support, now, I am still waiting in the cold! Great!"
2019-01-05 01:36:20+00:00,How many reports do we need to send to @AskLyft/@Uber_Support before these companies start doing something to discipline drivers for endangering lives? @DC_DFHV can you help regulate? It’s only a matter of time until there’s a far worse outcome. #VisionZeroDC #zerovisiondc

2019-01-04 22:27:52+00:00,Yesterday we got an Uber. The driver not in his consciousness. He didn't know his way and he was acting so weird! He suddenly cancelled our Uber ride and drove somewhere else. I have contacted @Uber @Uber_Support about this incident but the only thing they have done is a REFUND!

2019-01-04 02:36:41+00:00,sorry for flooding the timeline but there’s no way to get any real response from @Uber or @Uber_Support unless you blast them on social media
2019-01-03 21:26:40+00:00,So you got pissed and accepted a higher price on the app and then realised in the morning once sober and want a refund...
2019-01-03 21:14:05+00:00,"PH fares are not regulated, they can charge what they like! Some call it inative, others say let market forces dictate, Personally, I call it legalised mugging! Still, you pay your money and take your choice. Stay safe however you travel."
2019-01-03 17:22:44+00:00,"Basically in the same medium you failed me before. So all of this talk of ""we'll look into it"" was just talk. Thank you, @AmericanExpress for rectifying @Uber's wrong. @Uber_Support should take note of how Amex handles customer service. "

2019-01-02 14:01:27+00:00,It is absolutely buck wild that @Uber_Support doesn't have a customer help phone number. You can only call them via the app... which is not super helpful when the problem is that you need your phone back from the car.
2019-01-02 06:33:57+00:00,This is what I shown at time of booking and ended up paying. Informed driver took long route but he was not saying anything and just keep on driving. #Notsafe in @Uber @Uber_Support

2019-01-01 15:56:15+00:00,@Uber_Support hello! Happy New Years! Yet ANOTHER incident of being inappropriately charged - our Uber driver charged us for spilling or throwing up in the vehicle due to the fact that people were drunk she assumed nobody would remember- not the case. I’d like this resolved
2019-01-01 14:36:55+00:00,"@Uber_Support I had taken an Uber ride yesterday and at first was charged the exact fare and then an email telling that your receipt was adjusted and further charged on my card, why did this happen. Kindly look into this matter with serious concerns and please refund my card. "
2019-01-01 14:28:57+00:00,"It's not a charity org. It'd be commendable, but it's not an obligation. Neither should it be. Adults should be smart enough to limit their alcohol... or better yet, don't drink. Holding yourself accountable and giving your life more value > blaming a profit business."

2019-01-01 13:25:09+00:00,hi @Uber_Support - really shocked that you allowed your drivers to cancel when i was quoted £15-20 to then be quoted £58-68 AND be required to wait 22 mins!? we used @TfL in the end 
2019-01-01 11:17:09+00:00,How much time and effort have you put into getting your £1 back?
2019-01-01 10:47:38+00:00,"The driver asked where I was going & as it wasn’t far enough for him, so he cancelled, quite simple, happens all the time. Surely you you could monitor messaging and overlay cancellations - quite simple"
2019-01-01 10:37:17+00:00,that is disgusting - I Always use black cabs whenever in London last time driver showed up at restaurant with wallet my friend had left in cab not sure if these Uber links respond to your tweet @uber_support @uber @UberUKsupport but if not and act accordingly - don't use #HNYE

2019-01-01 10:07:38+00:00,What’s the email? This exact ride is never more than $40 and I just paid $140

2020-07-04 00:36:34+00:00,Uber immediately fired a driver following an unsubstantiated complaint but that isn't enough for perpetual victim Aisha. Where is the proof any of this even happened?
2020-07-03 17:44:30+00:00,"Who here is annoyed at @Uber ? A driver started my ride, proceeded with trip and completed the trip with out anyone in the car! I spoke @Uber_Support and they told me I am responsible for the cost of the ride! Where is the exchange of service that I am paying for? #SCAM"

2020-07-05 10:42:16+00:00,So you force your driver's to wear those suffocating things that will likely affect their ability to concentrate. If your drivers are not sick & coughing they should NOT be in a mask. If they are sick they should stay home.
2020-07-05 05:46:59+00:00,Bruh. @Uber_Support @Uber @UberEats get it together! Yu not even talking to the right people

2020-07-02 21:44:22+00:00,Uber is not paying it’s drivers! I still have not got my money from 2 weeks ago. #uber is scamming drivers and taking tips. @Uber_Support does nothing to help.

2020-06-30 01:19:36+00:00,"This time, I’m not just deleting my Uber app. I’m deleting my Uber account. The time for excuses and apologies is over, goodbye @uber"
2020-06-30 00:49:05+00:00,.@Uber @Uber_Support address this 
2020-06-30 00:28:52+00:00,@Uber_Support so this is the meal that I got maybe 30 minutes ago that I also threw away. It was missing items Including a meat pie i purchased. The meal is in disarray. The meats (goat and side of fried chicken) were rock hard...im furious that I wasted $20 on this. 
2020-06-30 00:12:29+00:00,"Sent. Not only is Uber legally liable for this, you have a moral obligation to find out who this person was to keep them from further endangering our community and it needs to be done TODAY."
2020-06-29 23:55:22+00:00,"@uber @Uber_Support since Critical Safety line gave me no support, I’m taking it here. You should be fucking ashamed of this. This is only one example of the rampant discrimination you let your drivers in control of."
2020-06-29 23:53:13+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support, one of your drivers just kicked my mom out of her ride because she doesn’t speak english. Your driver said “this is America” and cancelled so now there is no record of it. Does this hate-fueled racism represent your company?"
2020-06-29 23:11:48+00:00,@Uber_Support I placed an order and entered my Uber cash as the payment. The Uber cash was not applied. The help options weren’t useful and your website gives a 6 digit phone number. Who do I contact for assistance?
2020-06-29 20:50:28+00:00,"I wonder if I change my @Uber profile pic to a white woman I’ll get matched with drivers who show me some type of respect and not cancel my rides, give me longer waits, or higher fares because I am black. @Uber_Support"
2020-06-29 15:56:56+00:00,"Tried to leave a generous $100 tip for my Uber ride today, and was told it exceeded tip amount. Max I could leave was $20. Why cap it there @Uber_Support ? "
2020-06-29 10:30:26+00:00,See how @Uber_Support act? They want to look like they care on your tl and don't even look at your Dms Just say you are not going to sort this out because you don't care about your customers https://twitter.com/UberUKsupport/status/1277527309898170370
2020-06-28 20:09:04+00:00,Are you doing predictions today?
2020-06-28 09:53:05+00:00,How far now? but seriously I think @Uber_Support should pay customers if drivers waste our time! Why will I be charged if I waste the drivers time but won’t be compensated if he/she wastes mine? 
2020-06-28 02:49:31+00:00,@Uber_Support I love how on Uber you can have terrible customer service and it’s your fault. Good business model
2020-06-28 01:34:54+00:00,“You black people say nigga this nigga that how about you respect eachother then we’ll respect you” - my white @Uber_Support @Uber driver tonight
2020-06-28 00:33:42+00:00,"Yes, I contacted @bostonpizza immediately as well hoping that a new one could sent or that portion refunded. They told me that I had to deal with @UberEats @Uber_Support."
2020-06-27 18:20:06+00:00,@Uber_Support bro plz someone help me i'm trying to change my email on my uber account and it says it's sending me a code to my phone number and i'm literally not receiving anything ..
2020-06-27 18:00:51+00:00,"@Uber_Support please read your dms regarding a order issue and refund it’s important, thanks"
2020-06-27 15:10:03+00:00,"I’ve never had an issue with @ubereats_uk before until a few days ago, STILL waiting for a response to my complaint about missing items and the whole experience. What an absolute joke of a company. Never again. Reading so many others complaining as well @Uber_Support @UberEats"
2020-06-27 12:54:42+00:00,"Yesterday I was in two @Uber rides where drivers refused to wear masks, and this is the reply from @Uber_Support. If you think riding without a mask is an INCONVENIENCE, Uber you are really not paying any attention. #Floridacoronavirus"
2020-06-27 09:15:57+00:00,Seriously @Uber @Uber_Support the prices are a complete fucking joke when I can get a normal taxi for $20-$30 pic.twitter.com/wtMj5J4TfL
2020-06-27 07:08:43+00:00,Yo on some real shit @Uber_Support you guys are dead ass pieces of shit for charging 44 dollars to go ten minutes pay your fucking drivers instead of ripping off the rider hard earn money we know you guys racially profile areas and charge more
2020-06-27 01:31:29+00:00,".@Uber_Support you SUCK. I put the correct address in the app and YOU sent the guy to the wrong location in the middle of nowhere. You refunded the money in the app, but I wanted to send him a tip BECAUSE YOU SCREWED UP but there is no way to contact you"
2020-06-26 19:32:38+00:00,seriously fuck @Uber @Uber_Support and y’all bullshit outrageous surge prices that are going in your pockets and not to the drivers who are out here risking their health and safety
2020-06-26 18:40:02+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support i have send you message, kindly do the needful please."
2020-06-26 16:23:15+00:00,Can someone at @UberEats please explain to me why @Uber_Support would refuse to help resolve an app issue??
2020-06-26 16:23:02+00:00,@Uber_Support my card is valid but it keeps saying that 
2020-06-26 14:35:19+00:00,Black Trans lives Matter @Uber_Support @Uber
2020-06-26 14:32:57+00:00,I’m sick and tired of @Uber_Support @Uber treating the Black Trans Women horrible. It’s time we come together as a community and ban them from my life. I tried to talk to them enough is enough 
2020-06-26 11:27:08+00:00,I have seen your message @Uber_Support and I am waiting for your reply
2020-06-26 07:48:20+00:00,"The restaurant fully gave me a completely different item than I ordered and @Uber_Support is saying I’ve exceeded the refunds they can do????? In the past, I had proof of a driver giving me a damaged order and a restaurant constantly ignoring my requests. How is that even legal?"
2020-06-26 05:07:12+00:00,.@Uber_Support so this is “doing whatever you can to help”? are you kidding me? you selected replies from a list of prewritten sorry excuses for customer service? you claim to be helpful on a public tweet and then be the exact opposite of helpful privately? @UberEats
2020-06-25 22:56:42+00:00,I’m seriously upset right now. Why? 1. I waited 45 mins for a ride. 2. This driver was in the wrong pick up spot. 3. It smells like old cigarettes. 4. He won’t be quiet and he see my headphones in. 5. This is just all bad and I’m so over it. @uber @Uber_Support
2020-06-25 17:15:07+00:00,@Uber_Support so y’all have people who tested positive for coronavirus still making trips?
2020-06-25 16:22:30+00:00,"Y'all Do not order from @UberEats I had two (2) $30 off promos and they just vanished. Contacted @Uber_Support to reinstate these and they not only didn't, but they won't help at all. Keep marking my inquiry solved. Y'all really evil. Sorry I went behind your back, @DoorDash"
2020-06-25 14:50:36+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support really?
2020-06-25 07:39:28+00:00,"Please use #Bangla in ur branding, promotion and advertising. #WestBengal is a 10 crore market with 85% plus speaking Bangla. See how others are doing... @Uber_Support @UberEats @Uber @BanglaSommelon @BanglarDabi @BanglaPokkho"
2020-06-25 01:53:32+00:00,It’s kinda wack that I waited 2 hours for my @UberEats just for them to cancel my order and now everything to order from is closed @Uber_Support
2020-06-25 00:48:26+00:00,"So @Uber_Support my wife's @UberEats account is unusable. After going back and fourth with screenshots and messages, a few days ago they're reply was ""we've encountered an error, and the account can't be used until further notice"" a couple of days after I asked for an update."
2020-06-25 00:38:07+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support You’re telling me my driver was going 80mph in a 65mph lane. Endangering my life after I told him to slow down. And you guys can’t even refund me my money for that ride? 
2020-06-24 23:55:12+00:00,I swear @Uber_Support @UberEats sent me the same response 5 times. Such horrible customer service. @lyft here I come 
2020-06-24 23:31:27+00:00,"I let @Uber_Support know someone had hacked my account, which has my CC info, and updated my email such that I was locked out THREE DAYS AGO and still haven't received any meaningful updates. Still locked out and have to call my CC company to block any transactions from Uber."
2020-06-24 20:24:02+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support hey scum bags its me again , your driver still has my phone, and I got the cops involved, and when he called you guys , you were difficult and asked for a warrant lmao you're a trash ass organization"
2020-06-24 19:37:26+00:00,"Uber is the worst company. I’ll never forget when a driver verbally/physically assaulted me and in response, .@Uber / .@Uber_Support banned my account and made it impossible to press charges by preventing me his name and information. "
2020-06-24 18:39:03+00:00,i got an email saying my driver said i wasn’t wearing a mask when i WAS wearing a mask. a huge one. fire him and give me a discount for this. @Uber_Support
2020-06-24 15:04:48+00:00,I also saw on your profile where you said you pass on non latinx riders. That kind of bias is dangerous and what holds this country back. I really hope @Uber Is taking a look @Uber_Support
2020-06-24 14:17:11+00:00,"So our @Uber driver on Sunday had a mask on that didn’t cover his nose (&amp; no other protective measures), &amp; @Uber_Support’s way of handling it is to “look into it” (even after offering photographic proof, they didn’t ask for it in investigating it) Tbh pretty furious about it."
2020-06-24 02:06:55+00:00,Two bad experiences on @UberEats @Uber_Support in one day! Completely got my order wrong yesterday and today my driver completely took my food LMAO I CANT MAKE THIS UP
2020-06-23 21:37:28+00:00,Hey @ubereats @Uber_Support Why's your driver just cancelled my order within not even a minute of ringing the doorbell? I practically ran down the stairs to find that he was nowhere to be found and that I had been charged???
2020-06-23 21:14:52+00:00,Yeah. Nah @Uber isn’t about to get money from me for cancelling a trip I waited for about 25 minutes when it was supposed to take him 8 minutes to get there. That ain’t happening. @Uber_Support 
2020-06-23 20:32:53+00:00,You guys have the worst support team there is. I’ve been unable to work for MORE THAN 15 DAYS waiting for you to run a background check. Worst part? I still haven’t got a solid response. Just vague and standard scripted answers. @Uber_Support
2020-06-23 20:13:53+00:00,Today’s @Uber driver didn’t have a mask on and told me I didn’t have to wear mine. I told him I preferred to wear it. Very uncomfortable ride. @Uber_Support

2020-06-20 03:08:20+00:00,@Uber_Support It looks like I'm not even getting a refund for food that was literally missing from an order either? How is that okay? The restaurant admitted to me that they forgot two items and I'm still forced to pay for them because I've reported order issues in the past?
2020-06-20 02:25:16+00:00,"Alright... if an Uber driver cancels over 10 minutes after ordering, then I should be able to charge a cancellation fee too or get a credit toward my next ride. That’s bullshit. I will go FULL KAREN. Time is money for us all @Uber @Uber_Support"

2020-06-19 22:35:57+00:00,@UberEats @Uber_Support My order has been delayed for two hours and I just want my money back at this point 
2020-06-19 21:45:03+00:00,8 hours and counting-- @Uber @Uber_Support I've been contacting all day and can't travel because you won't provide me excellent customer service. Why make your Gold member customers wait 8 hours when they have been in constant communication? #Uber
2020-06-19 21:04:51+00:00,IT'S A MIRACLE! They did the absolute bare minimum! Still done with their services forever.
2020-06-19 20:30:19+00:00,Watch them refund you immediately if this post blows up. Corps only care about their public image when its at jeapordy or getting negative PR. I do hope your $10 + more. GL
2020-06-19 20:02:43+00:00,"Every time you send me a discount code, it never works @Uber_Support"
2020-06-19 19:22:16+00:00,Something about Uber being super surged in Bronzeville right now seems racist. Like I know; there’s a lot of traffic happening but you hoes should’ve read the room. @Uber_Support where’s my Juneteenth discount? 
2020-06-19 16:07:56+00:00,My Uber eats driver stole my order. Literally watched her on my cameras. @Uber_Support let’s chat before I really cut up.
2020-06-19 08:18:09+00:00,Before that I got an @Uber_Support once and the address stopped 4 doors away from my home and he refused to stop at my actual door this didn’t feel safe ... they don’t care all they care for is your money
2020-06-19 08:16:48+00:00,Agreed!! I hate @Uber_Support I stopped using them when I got attacked in the street by a drunk man outside a bar whilst getting into my Uber and the Uber didn’t even get out and help and I cried in the car on way home. Zero empathy from Uber. Disgrace
2020-06-19 07:49:22+00:00,We are sorry to hear about this experience and would like to follow up with you for more information. Please provide us with your email address via DM so we can escalate this issue.
2020-06-19 04:17:22+00:00,Yes you were right. Got a call from @Uber_India yesterday where they said the driver denied there was any phone ! Reality is twice he disconnected my call and then.switched it off.
2020-06-19 02:36:54+00:00,Okay but I spent 3 days emailing with you all. You have the whole incident in your DM right now from the MINUTE I got kicked out of the car. Like I don’t know what else you need to hear or read to understand what I am telling you about the incident that happened to me
2020-06-19 02:17:26+00:00,"Well it wasn’t. Your person assigned to this essentially said, “I’m sorry, we’re gonna talk to him” then told me to have a good day & that was the end of it. I don’t need racism from your drivers & lack of empathy from your company after I get kicked out of a car post-BLM march"
2020-06-18 14:48:43+00:00,@Uber_Support Uber driver deliberately taking longer trips to double the price of the ride. It took me 45 minutes instead of 15 to get to Gare Montparnasse and I missed my train. It cost me 200€ to get another train ticket. Scamming customers is the new post covid strategy ?
2020-06-18 14:10:48+00:00,@Uber_Support Wanna tell my why my driver picked up my food at 8:20am and DROVE AWAY. 
2020-06-18 11:06:29+00:00,@Uber_Support my app still shows “pick up soon” but the driver does not show enroute? 
2020-06-18 11:00:20+00:00,Excellent idea!! @Uber_Support @Olacabs why don't you have #Bengali branding ideas or concepts for #Bengal You should consider this issue &amp; think about it

2020-06-15 23:36:57+00:00,He picked up a lady who wanted to be dropped off at U of C. His seats need to be replaced. @Uber_Support needs to step up. He claims he’s losing $600 a day in revenue. I doubt that. No Uber driver is making $600 a day. Especially in a pandemic. 
2020-06-15 20:28:00+00:00,@UberEats I heard y’all don’t stand for racism? This restaurant isn’t a good look for your platform then.
2020-06-15 18:50:08+00:00,"Just went and got the food myself. Apparently, Uber Eats is not viable in my city if there are no drivers available to deliver from a restaurant less than one mile away within an hour's time.

2020-06-15 16:41:28+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats A week ago I notified you about Vince's Crab House. The public racial postings for years by their owner. And the immediate call from our community to have them removed from your listing. Yet they are still listed? Do #BlackLivesMatter or was it PR?
2020-06-15 16:36:09+00:00,They actually do dumbass it’s a support account they respond to anyone who complains just look at their replies
2020-06-15 16:33:44+00:00,"i reported it when it happened in July 2018, you guys did nothing. please leave me alone"
2020-06-15 15:52:31+00:00,Of course they responded. This dude has a check mark next to his name. They know he has followers. Companies never respond to the little pions that have 50 follows that complain about a product.
2020-06-15 14:31:39+00:00,“Your @Uber driver stated they are wearing a mask.” Get in the car. No mask on the driver. This happens CONSTANTLY. @Uber_Support
2020-06-15 14:00:30+00:00,@Uber_Support @UberEats please remove them from your platform
2020-06-15 07:28:42+00:00,@Uber_Support I'm truly sorry sir &amp; I'm truly sorry to the company I represent.

2020-06-12 13:20:15+00:00,So @Uber are also enforcing use of face coverings &amp; will ban people from the app if they are reported as not wearing one too many times. Yet @GOVUK exempt people with respiratory conditions. Does this mean people with #asthma can't use Uber? https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/news/face-covering-advice-for-people-with-asthma @Uber_Support 
2020-06-12 07:53:51+00:00,@Uber_Support your customer service sucks. I have sent numerous emails with a legitimate issue and I keep getting emailed responses that are obviously computer generated. Please address this! Your app is assigning fake drivers!!!
2020-06-12 01:33:20+00:00,The safety measures by #Uber. Is this to protect the driver or the rider? #DelhiUber @Uber @Uber_Support 
2020-06-11 23:48:46+00:00,@Uber_Support my whole Uber Eats order was wrong and a refund of only part of the order was given. Your app won’t let me submit for the rest of the refund.

2020-06-11 00:51:13+00:00,Thank you. My concern is that you are advertising supporting black owned businesses through the app. But that the option displayed for less than a day and is no longer available. I’m not sure my phone number and a DM will help.
2020-06-10 21:57:31+00:00,I cannot log into my Driver account because I have a new number and when I log in it sends an SMS to my OLD number so i don’t receive it and I can’t change my number from a computer and I’m getting NO email responses how in gods name do I get around this @Uber_Support @UberEats
2020-06-10 21:07:32+00:00,I’d literally have to give you my entire male driver history from the last two years. I had one dude who didn’t sexually harass me. One.
2020-06-10 20:55:36+00:00,I can’t wait. I can’t wait. I can’t wait. I have literally been aggressively sexually harassed by 9/10 male @Uber_Support and @lyft drivers I’ve had. Every female driver has been greeted with such relief they get so angry that all the women they drive are so relieved to see them.

2020-06-09 11:47:59+00:00,"Understanding? No cupcake, you're missing the point. BASING PRICING & SERVICES ON RACE IS RACIST. I'm not prepared to deal with an openly racist business, so this is the end of our relationship, period."
2020-06-09 11:24:33+00:00,Dear Uber start by treating your predominately black drivers decently. How about censuring the unscrupulous owners who own vehicles and pay a pittance
2020-06-09 10:53:23+00:00,Racial injustice in South Africa where white people are the absolute MINORITY with 26 years if majority black rule! Racial Injustice? PHIFFF I WILL NEVER USE THE RACIST UBER AGAIN

2020-06-09 08:58:05+00:00,"Don't worry about it @uber_support, the majority of restaurant owners in South Africa is white. So they'll be the ones who suffer from any local boycott. We're trying to flatten the white minority ownership of the economy curve here. Thank you for helping."

I will provide the details ...someone new asks for X details again... I am on the fifth iteration of this currently. Are these humans or robots?

2020-06-06 02:56:40+00:00,6 months free rides would make up for the emotional distress he has to go through due to your company hiring racist drivers. Especially during times like these I’m sure you watch the news

2020-06-04 15:25:19+00:00,@Uber_Support I’m being refused a refund for a ride I took today and I had to walk. Have you ever walked into a gated community in Florida in 80 degree weather?

2020-05-31 07:38:43+00:00,the phone number is 4804943363 it was may 30th at 6:27 PM. One of your drivers used his political leanings to deny a rider of color heading to a protest about protecting people of color and their rights.
2020-05-31 06:44:53+00:00,He probably might have used a spell on her. Entering your PIN instead of the amount isn’t normal because 1. You’re asked for the amount 2. You’re asked to enter the PIN itself 3. You’re shown a confirmation text before Meaning you had to overlook all of these. We’ll find him tho
2020-05-31 05:42:50+00:00,.. @AskLyft @lyft this is not ok people need to get out of places safely and you are failing to do so!! There are no metros running @metrolosangeles what is going on?? This is safe enough outside of DTLA to request a ride. @Uber_Support @Uber DO NOT PRICE SURGE !!!

2020-05-30 00:13:57+00:00,@Uber_Support do you guys have a customer service department email or is that just impossible to find? How about a phone number? Absolutely rediulous how hard it is to get in touch with you.

2020-04-17 03:55:41+00:00,@Uber_Support extremely dissatisfying customer service especially in a time like this
2020-04-16 18:11:32+00:00,@UberEats if you scam one of my bros you lose ALL my bros’ business I hope you know that
2020-04-16 18:01:05+00:00,Wtf????? As if there wasn’t enough to worry about. I’m so sorry that you have to deal with such a terrible company!
2020-04-16 14:23:14+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @Hyrecar I have still yet to be able to get online. It's been three days... Can someone contact me to help me configure my app to properly read my location?
2020-04-16 12:07:50+00:00,"I was liking the @Uber pop ups wrt to their fund collection to support their drivers who are out of work due to the #lockdown. But now, they are texting things like 17 drivers have helped you reach the airport!!! Well. Avoidable, no? @Uber_Support @Uber_India"
2020-04-16 08:28:44+00:00,"Just a reminder that despite years of asking @ubereats_uk @UberEats @Uber_Support to see if theres a way I can get this distance reviewed Im still (literally) no closer I would happily order regularly, especially now but still no response. Please #StayAtHome #Uber #UberEats"
2020-04-16 07:44:44+00:00,Why have I been charged for my last 2 rides with @Uber when I had 10 free rides for working for the #NHS ? @Uber_Support 
2020-04-16 03:03:47+00:00,Wtf you had someone basically steal $80 during a pandemic??? Should’ve even gotten their stimulus check today. Wow. I’m so sorry to hear man. @UberEats I hope you guys are able to help him out!! ):
2020-04-16 01:29:50+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support Where can I send a complaint about tonight's UberEats experience? I've already tried chatting; may I email or message you?
2020-04-15 23:22:50+00:00,"Wow @Uber_Support, keep it up with ${complimentReason} "
2020-04-15 16:20:05+00:00,Why should i pay @Uber ? Please enlighten me #uberindia #ubercab @Uber_India @Uber_Support @uber
2020-04-15 12:51:48+00:00,Done!
2020-04-15 09:06:26+00:00,"Delivery to the wrong person, just like your food."
2020-04-15 09:05:40+00:00,"Lol, thats actually hilarious."
2020-04-15 00:51:43+00:00,I’ve been asking @Uber_Support the same question for about a month now and I continue to get the same automated response from their reps. It’s been frustrating to say the least. I’ll continue trying with the hopes one of their representatives is willing to help.
2020-04-14 22:40:41+00:00,"Boycotting @UberEats and I don't play games with my money, so I won't be taking @Uber either. @Uber_Support ain't taking this seriousn- I'm done"
2020-04-14 18:32:13+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support You charged me $2.5k, it would be nice if you would explain and refund this charge instead of giving me the runaround "
2020-04-14 15:16:30+00:00,I am uber driver i have expectations of financial help from uber in this lockdown period not able to drive in these days but uber not doing any help its too strange @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India
2020-04-14 02:11:56+00:00,@UberEats @Uber_Support @Uber I tweeted at you 2 hours ago to say a bag of @McDonalds we did not order was left on our doorstep. It’s still sitting there. How about a customer service number during #coronavirus ? #FoodWaste #CustomerService #VegansDoNotAppreciateWastingMeat
2020-04-13 21:27:14+00:00,"And the award for the worst customer support EVER goes to @Uber_Support @Uber - OMG I’ve never seen so much incompetence in a few email exchanges. Bottom line, someone used my email address to create an account and trying to sort that out with support to delete it is a quest."
2020-04-13 19:17:19+00:00,My first choice too.
2020-04-13 19:01:27+00:00,Can confirm! Always my first choice for taxis!
2020-04-13 18:36:03+00:00,"Really fed up with the absolute uselessness of @Uber_Support. After requesting a number or email to use to contact someone at least three times, they basically tell me “we sent you an email, that’s all we know how to do. Sorry we charged you twice” #Uber needs to be regulated."
2020-04-13 17:42:10+00:00,I certainly can. First rate service
2020-04-13 17:17:00+00:00,Where/ What Are The Discounts For Essential Workers Using @Uber @Uber_Support @lyft @AskLyft
2020-04-13 16:34:15+00:00,Use @letDRIVEtakeU instead of a global entity that has no concept of customer service - both during and after the ride. Ask @JohnLDixon a regular customer of ours who once left keys in 1 of our cars and had them returned with no drama. @HelenMaryCymru can vouch for us as well.
2020-04-13 12:26:55+00:00,"Yo @Uber_Support can you make sure drivers have the proper equipment before getting on the road? Signed, mine almost drove off the road because he doesn’t have a mount for his phone and is trying to text/navigate from his lap"
2020-04-13 00:09:43+00:00,It’s okay the Uber driver is no longer with us @Uber_Support 
2020-04-12 15:56:43+00:00,Perhaps Uber can take this time to improve their bot responses.
2020-04-11 13:20:20+00:00,Just got a lesson earlier tonight that evil people do still exist in this world. Thank you so much @Uber_Support. Just... thanks 
2020-04-11 11:00:47+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support needs to include in their Covid 19 section that prices may be tripled because we know trains aren't running well so we need to make money. Its ridiculous. But yet we have no choice. Its just beyond crazy a 24 dollar trip being 53 dollars. #makethisviral
2020-04-11 00:59:35+00:00,"@redlobster @UberEats @Uber @Uber_Support . Red Lobster on Duke St in Alexandria VA, is fraudulently markin tht customers hav pked up food, when they haven’t.

2020-04-10 17:50:31+00:00,This is not an acceptable response @Uber_Support. If this is what you call good customer service I won’t be using ubereats again. Our pizza was stone cold and you offered us an insulting £2.49 credit. 
2020-04-10 14:49:07+00:00,"@Uber_India dear sir , Uber is helping their drivers 3000 Rs in lockdown , bit this help is only for car drivers , so what about auto drivers ? They also need help , please do something for auto drivers also. @Uber @Uber_Support @PMOIndia @CMOMaharashtra"

2020-04-10 00:21:18+00:00,@UberEats @Uber_Support @BBBTriCounties uh the almost $100 food order @somedayboy made arrived 20 minutes late AND Ice cold. How do you now have a customer service number
2020-04-09 18:26:47+00:00,I report to @Uber_Support that I got ran over 2 weeks ago and never heard back. Plus they owe me 5$since December! DONT worry I’ll take the day off! I’ll get some rest and relax. 3 dollar and 4 dollar orders just not gonna cut it in a pandemic. #COVIDー19 #COVID19 #SCAM
2020-04-09 17:21:41+00:00,Hi @Uber_Support - I just got my first-ever UberEats delivery &amp; it's delicious. I just noticed that the receipt you emailed me doesn't include the tip I added when I ordered. He did a good job &amp; I want to make sure he's taken care of. Will I get another receipt that shows it?
2020-04-09 15:55:08+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber @uber @alirazak27 @PhlDriversUnion @SenBobCasey I’ve been waiting since March 16th for COVID-19 relief from Uber. I’ve provided all of the necessary documentation stating that I was tested and under mandatory self quarantine for 14 days. Still no reply
2020-04-09 14:53:59+00:00,Wish @Uber_Support would reactivate my ability to drive @UberEats! I’ve been falsely accused of not completing deliveries and that’s not true! 3 weeks of lost income because they don’t listen.
2020-04-09 14:53:59+00:00,"ATTENTION @Uber | @Uber_Support | @DKHOS MAKE PROMOTIONS FOR YOUR HARDWORKING DRIVERS IN #ATLANTA! THEY ARE SACRIFICING THEIR LIVES, MAKING LITTLE TO NOTHING WHILE TRANSPORTING PASSENGERS! TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. #UBER #UBERDRIVERS #COVID19 #CORONAVIRUS @Streetz945atl"
2020-04-09 14:04:55+00:00,@Uber_Support My order never arrived yesterday so I message support. Support tells me they won't refund me for food I never got and that I can rate the restaurant? I ordered food right after their first meal didn't arrive and ruined my family's virtual Passover. I want my refund!
2020-04-09 14:00:43+00:00,"As a result of nobody at @Uber @Uber_Support @UberUKsupport refusing to help, I have opened a fraud case with my bank."
2020-04-09 12:49:23+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberUKsupport Any chance of getting some help? You've taken money from my bank account for a trip fraudulently taken using my name and details.
2020-04-08 19:21:17+00:00,Just a quick thank you to @Uber for providing NHS staff with free rides during this Pandemic. It is very much appreciated and helps us get home at a reasonable time in preparation for the next days shift! #keyworker #COVID19 @Uber_Support
2020-04-08 16:15:30+00:00,An update: @Uber_Support is useless and apparently giving 20% off some rides to certain hospitals (one of which is the same affiliate as the hospital i work for but different location...) so i don’t make the cut... smh 
2020-04-08 00:25:16+00:00,@Uber_Support I have had two deliveries today where the restaurant was closed and I could not get a hold of support because apparently there is no one there. I drove 5 miles for a delivery and can’t even be compensated. What can I do?
2020-04-08 00:23:06+00:00,@Uber_Support having trouble logging in. Will not go into my driver app. Are some areas just not using Uber at these times
2020-04-07 23:09:27+00:00,I'm not holding my breath that @Uber_Support or @Uber will ever reach out. My hope is to stop others from ending up $50 short because a restaurant cancels and they won't refund.
2020-04-07 13:21:38+00:00,This is not helpful nobody is riding anywhere except healthcare workers because everyone is on quarantine..
2020-04-07 04:51:37+00:00,@Uber_Support @UberEats @Uber How do you explain having the wrong address for a fast food restaurant then not helping the customers figure out why they had to go through 4 drivers to figure out on their own that's its the wrong address.
2020-04-06 22:00:51+00:00,@Uber_Support Spoke to your driver he said he does have my wallet but he’s too busy to return it I want my Wallet back
2020-04-05 02:30:49+00:00,"Papa johns sent me a regular pizza instead of a vegan one once and it was the first time I was ordering it so I was so confused if it was vegan or not- what if I was allergic to dairy?! like wtf, didn’t get a refund either"
2020-04-05 01:21:29+00:00,Thanks! @Uber_Support For Helping Assist My Troubles With A Recent Order. 
2020-04-04 22:55:41+00:00,"whoever does that, definitely not real friends."
2020-04-04 22:35:23+00:00,@Uber_Support so you’re gonna ignore the whole thread?
2020-04-04 19:24:20+00:00,For a second time now my @UberEats driver marked the order delivered and just drove off. Unbelievable @Uber_Support
2020-04-04 19:16:56+00:00,"i remember when i ate a piece of meat after going vegan i almost threw up. it doesn’t have to be just your stomach issue but a mental one, too. your mind just rejects & makes you get rid of something you subconsciously find disgusting but of course that varies."
2020-04-04 19:06:48+00:00,"Yes! Or when you order like a “veggie fajita” or something, and the waistress is like ??? You know you can add chicken or steak for 3 dollars? And I’m like? I’m ordering a veggie version for a reason lmao"
2020-04-04 18:38:03+00:00,"Yeah, it's also food tampering if it's done and the only response is ""oh well sorry lol"" People who've been vege for long, their bodies adapt to survive without meat. This can be very harmful"
2020-04-04 18:37:28+00:00,"Food tampering, especially if you get sick because you've been vege for a year. Remind them that food tampering is a crime and I'm sure you'll get a refund."
2020-04-04 18:35:03+00:00,it’s a dietary issue so why can’t they act responsible about it.
2020-04-04 18:35:00+00:00,That’s ridiculous Deliveroo gave me a refund when I told them my vegan pad thai had bits of meat in it uber really need to be doing better
2020-04-04 18:34:06+00:00,honestly why do companies have to be like this
2020-04-04 16:16:27+00:00,"Didn’t knock on the door, didn’t even open the gate, didn’t leave the food. Rang from an interstate number apparently though which you guys say is enough of an out clause to not refund our dinner. Why not at door?

2020-04-03 17:50:30+00:00,Now more than i ever i need any help you are able to give. @Uber @Uber_Support shut me down completely today. They wont get back to me as to why. Just that it is final.

2020-03-31 03:25:00+00:00,Thank you for the info. It’s a good general reference to about plans & definitions. It doesn’t contain any authority or mention of the effect of stay-at-home orders. In DC ride share programs are limited to 2 passengers

He needs to be held accountable for his actions and needs to take care of the drivers who are keeping his business alive.

2020-03-25 21:00:04+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support can you please stop allowing people to register using other people's email addresses with no confirmation? I'm tired of getting notifications for some random person's activity in South Africa.
2020-03-25 13:06:53+00:00,That would be AMAZING!! I have his name and number!
2020-03-25 13:06:16+00:00,@Uber @ChickfilA @Uber_Support is there soemthing we can do for this driver? That was beyond amazing for Lauren.

2020-03-25 02:43:16+00:00,"former uber driver and current bank employee. change your passwords. Call paypal first. Bank claims on debit transactions are a slower process. Paypal is the better bet for first contact. Don't waste your time with Uber support, it's mostly canned responses. im sorry :("

2020-03-24 14:56:36+00:00,"No but seriously, what the actual F? If you’re doing no delivery fee then stick to it. Don’t find another reason to stick that delivery fee into a new, additional charge. It’s insincere and shady."

2020-03-23 20:46:22+00:00,This is what @Uber_Support had to say after I requested for them to remove the unfair review if possible. The review itself is out of their hands but they’re trying to figure out another way to accommodate. 
2020-03-23 16:56:55+00:00,Imagine ordering @McDonaldsUK on the last day for delivery and being a child and only receiving 3 nuggets instead of 4 @UberEats @Uber_Support

2020-03-23 12:24:53+00:00,"@UberEats @Uber_Support are you reducing commission fees to restaurants right now? Free delivery for customers is awesome, but 30% cut from restaurants KILLS restaurants right now."

2020-03-20 23:34:19+00:00,#Uber should only allow 4.4 stars and above drivers right now. Even if it's a ranking just for this #coronavirus period. Dirty cars could infect us all. And you should send those drivers hand sanitizer. Partner with a distillery. Make it happen NOW @Uber @UberEats @Uber_Support
2020-03-20 22:01:29+00:00,I just want my damn money back @Uber_Support whats good

2020-03-19 02:00:51+00:00,Hey @Uber @Uber_Support maybe educate the drivers that work for you in @chicago that blocking @ChiPubSchools food deliveries during the #COVID19 pandemic and spitting on the delivery truck is bad form.

2020-03-18 19:59:10+00:00,"Hello Ralph. I have not heard of this video until you brought it to my attention. I am deeply saddened by this development and hope, that during this trying times, we can come together and understand if struggling people cannot afford to tip."
2020-03-18 18:43:56+00:00,I sincerely hope that @Uber @Uber_Support is offering a money incentive to their drivers who are going to be hit especially hard by the cancellation of these services. The vast majority of drivers use Uber as a second source of income and don’t make very much to begin with.
2020-03-18 18:24:27+00:00,"Then, he called me a black bitch for wanting my phone back? Is it crack? @Uber @Uber_Support"
2020-03-18 14:22:28+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber there should be way to let passengers know that the driver has pets in their car so we aren't blind sided by pet dander on top of our allergies!
2020-03-18 11:24:56+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_India over 21hours and Uber is not even bothered to respond. When your response system is so slow how will you even address the issues of your customers. Such an irresponsible behaviour @Palaksharmanews @anishsingh21 @imvivekgupta @dperi84
2020-03-18 08:12:46+00:00,@UberEats @Uber_Support I’ve noticed I’ve been charged from my debit card for an uber eats purchase but I’ve never ordered with you guys! There’s no way to contact customer support on the app or site... I want my money refunded!
2020-03-18 00:03:44+00:00,Hey @UberEats @Uber_Support can you please chill with the service fees? Would love to support small businesses and restaurants - don't think you guys really need the 15% cut right now.
2020-03-17 21:25:29+00:00,"How have @Uber been able to take £80 from my account for “damage to vehicle”?!

2020-03-11 17:37:39+00:00,Look mate the greatest magic trick that Uber have done is to convince the travelling public that they re invented the wheel when in actuality it's just a bargain basement minicab app that employs the previously unemployable in order to sustain those prices.
2020-03-11 17:27:29+00:00,They would have impounded his vehicle and fined him as much as 20k. I can understand his desperation. I told my regular airport taxi driver in PH recently that they are only fighting the inevitable. Their days are numbered. Technology will put airport cabs out of business SoL.
2020-03-11 16:21:14+00:00,"Me: let’s try the credit card company... *calls* *talks to human in 2 minutes* *human cancels card, sends me a new one, and credits my account for fraud charges* done in 7 minutes.

2020-03-11 07:17:54+00:00,I was in the taxi with Michael and can confirm he took a massive jobby on the mat. It was disgusting. £50 is cheap.
2020-03-11 06:46:14+00:00,This simpleton has just stung me for an additional £50 on my fare for ‘cleaning’ which to me looks like rain water or something similar. Imagine having the brass neck to charge someone £50 for liquid being on a protective cover and for @Uber_Support to actually agree with it. 
2020-03-11 03:31:47+00:00,"Hey @Uber_Support, I have an @Uber account in case one of my adult children has car problems. That happened today. I tried to use it today to help my son in Florida. My credit card was out of date. Your app rejected my attempt to update it. My son and I are disappointed."

2020-03-09 15:28:52+00:00,Problems I’ve had with @Uber: - drivers who don’t speak English - dangerous drivers - sexual harassment - their @Uber_Support that doesn’t even offer a number or people you can talk to - refunds that are lower than the damage they caused you - delays
2020-03-09 00:00:51+00:00,"Good Lord, please give the driver a raise for dealing with a hostile passenger who posts about wishing him physical violence."
2020-03-08 22:35:42+00:00,"Honestly @Uber_Support is one of the most shocking customer service experiences I've ever had in my life. 20min call try to get a refund on two orders as both orders that arrived were not mine. Only given a refund on one, they cant refund two lol... genuinely a horrible process."
2020-03-08 20:10:20+00:00,"Why - so you can fire the driver over this pretentious has-been? The driver is only trying to make a living. So what if he made a couple of incorrect right turns. Don’t let this spoiled, egotistical person ruin his life...geez...."
2020-03-08 17:36:10+00:00,"Hello @Uber @Uber_India and @Uber_Support I've always tweeted to you when something has gone wrong and I need to vent some steam! For a change, things are different today. My family just took a ride, and the person in the driver's seat was a gentleman named Salim!"

2020-03-07 07:35:27+00:00,“Due to the severity of this incident” are they having you on?! That is literally a bit of mud someone can dust off themselves. The driver is definitely trying to pull a fast one!!

2020-03-05 23:06:53+00:00,You have to complain this to the British @UberUK @UberUKsupport @Uber @Uber_Support .. so they can take action against the driver and suspend his Uber license.

2020-03-04 03:39:44+00:00,Thanks for the feedback! We have provided safe driving training to some cab drivers in the past. @trafficchd would love to regularly train all @Uber_CHD @ola_chandigarh drivers. All they need to do is drop an email at psspst@chd.nic.in.
2020-03-04 00:34:22+00:00,Violence against women? Seriously? Your mother would be so proud. Do you not have your delivery drivers knock on your door at home? You’re probably so miserable because you don’t order enough Dominos.
2020-03-03 23:21:05+00:00,Just heard from Uber the driver was fired. Was supporting 12 children.
2020-03-03 19:05:32+00:00, im the same way. And it’s great that you gave him the benefit of the doubt. You don’t know what he could have possibly experienced this morning/before your ride.

2020-02-29 14:30:10+00:00,Curious @AskLyft @Uber_Support why no contact with drivers about the #CoronaVirus as drivers do airport runs and are in close quarters. Just waiting to know if drivers matter to these companies.

2020-02-20 11:21:56+00:00,Will Uber care about those they can now remove at the instant touch of a button? Governments & regulators are just as guilty for allowing Uber to enslave the lowest income earners. Any one who now uses these platforms are also guilty of exploiting these drivers.

2020-02-15 02:45:38+00:00,Dear @Uber @Uber_Support Do you have any incentive to train your drivers not to ask for destination or payment mode just to cancel the trips. You are not taking us on free rides and there is something called as customer preference. Please work on it.

2020-02-09 15:26:49+00:00,"Quoted £18-21 by @Uber for a trip in London. Ended up being charged £39.89 for the journey and LOOK AT MY DRIVERS JOURNEY. This is crazy. Uber will not accept responsibility, and I want my money back so someone has to win right? @Uber_Support @UberUK"
2020-02-09 15:15:04+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support why should I pay for a trip which your driver cancelled causing me inconvenience???? Should I be paying for my own inconvenience Seriously disappointed

2020-02-09 07:11:59+00:00,Hope @Uber @Uber_Support takes action against him proactively. Guys see the face of this psycopath. It's the duty to give service not to become a cow vigilant !

2020-02-08 18:19:29+00:00,. @Uber_Support @Uber shouldn't be hiring such Mental Unstable People. What if some day instead of dropping A Girl to the Destination he take them to some where else and do something then who will be responsible?
2020-02-08 17:56:12+00:00,@Uber_Support should cancel his license. @BJP4India can give him employment.

The @Uber driver HARASSES the passenger by making up a fake story (of Anti-nationalism) and takes the passenger to a police station to be harassed by cops. 2. The @Uber driver THREATENS the passenger with alternative 'consequences'. Does @Uber_Support these?

2020-02-05 05:16:38+00:00,That’s all well and good @Uber_Support but maybe having actual humans responding to customer problems from the get go would be more helpful. It’s a shame that the only way to get a response from companies these days is to publicly shame them on social media.

Unfortunately she’s played him to get home and broomed him at destination. He gone home and that’s his get out of jail card. Painful I know but that’s how it went. Sorry Chick.

2020-01-28 14:10:13+00:00,God bless the kind heart who had taken the Dog to medical care. Please share the contact no of the hospital so that somebody could share the cost Laws in India should punish the driver for his actions.These psychopaths if not punished will be a threat to Indian society in future
2020-01-28 13:59:52+00:00,"Kannadigas, please help show @Uber_India that apathy towards innocent animals won't go unnoticed. I am giving them ome star and opting for @Olacabs"
2020-01-28 13:54:59+00:00,WTF he could have easily avoided the poor dog. He seems to have done this on purpose! Shame on @Uber_India for taking no action against him!
2020-01-28 13:42:55+00:00,Hey @Uber_India my friend has been following up regarding a callous case of a hit and run by your driver in #Bengaluru and yet there's no response from you. @imVkohli She has shared details of the @Uber_Support @Uber @dkhos
2020-01-28 04:34:24+00:00,"@Uber_Support here’s a screenshot of my $1,445.09 Uber cash balance taken yesterday while planning a trip, a testament to my trust in your brand; trust I’d like to keep if you would simply return our money or provide responses on how to reactivate accounts. @Uber #uberdisabled https://twitter.com/karlaalindahao/status/1222002199879962634"
2020-01-28 02:26:32+00:00, Heads up transit ridership That also use @Uber please be aware that @Uber_Support has apparently gone on some crazy mass account Disabling Spree this even #BadCompany
2020-01-28 01:06:33+00:00,"@Uber_Support I see I'm not alone. Got off work , tried to get my Uber only to find account disabled. Followed instructions to reinstate and no response. Had to call a family member to pick me up. Hope this gets resolved soon!!!"
2020-01-28 00:51:59+00:00,@Uber_Support can somebody explain to me why my account was disabled without telling me &amp; leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere?
2020-01-28 00:14:58+00:00,"Oh no nothing to discuss. Just saying that a driver can cancel after selecting a ride and we don’t get rewarded for our time being wasted, but we as users are charged if we do the same thing. Double standard"
2020-01-27 23:38:55+00:00,Someone explain why @Uber can cancel and we don’t get a credit but if we cancel we’re charged... @Uber_Support
2020-01-27 23:23:59+00:00,So my @Uber account has been disabled for some reason. Anyone else have this happen to them? @Uber_Support #uber

2020-01-26 21:08:15+00:00,Disabled people and their service animals are guaranteed access to transit and public transit in accordance with the ADA.
2020-01-26 19:46:04+00:00,Hell nah @Uber. You will refund my cancellation fee. The driver was going in a different direction. He was first 2 minutes away. Then 7 and I canceled this ride when he was 15 minutes away. @Uber_Support 
2020-01-26 19:37:18+00:00,@Uber withholds driver and incident info from police to discourage prosecution. Why is this allowed?
2020-01-26 19:21:22+00:00,"Excellent question, one that @uber should perhaps address at a systemic level instead of acting like each incident is isolated."
2020-01-26 19:20:29+00:00,"They know that, they ban them occasionally for it, but not as often as it actually happens"
2020-01-26 19:16:31+00:00,"In Britian, the equivalent law is the Equality Act that says disabled people (amongst others) cannot be treated unfavourably by public services"
2020-01-26 06:48:45+00:00,Ok @Uber @Uber_Support I thought all of your drivers had to have 4-door cars? Because the car I am currently in only has 2 doors and so I’m sitting in the front seat and it’s awkward as hell
2020-01-25 20:32:04+00:00,"Yes, let's give everyone, including predators, the ability to ensure they get a female driver. What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-01-25 17:09:32+00:00,This wouldn’t be very safe for female Uber drivers.
2020-01-25 16:55:13+00:00,"I will say I've looked into driving for them and that would make me feel unsafe. Theres no way to vet who asks for a female driver, and bad things happen all the time to both drivers and riders. I'd feel incredibly unsafe and easier to target if it were an option."
2020-01-25 16:41:53+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support Your driver left us in middle of a flyover and abused when confronted that we will report this incident. 
2020-01-25 16:37:25+00:00,So does that mean you would be ok with your driver choosing to cancel your trip as they do not feel safe with you as a passenger? Cause you might be waiting a real long time for your ride
2020-01-25 16:12:09+00:00,Welcome back sweetheart
2020-01-25 16:07:20+00:00,Im pretty sure most men wouldnt feel safe driving you about after your behaviour let alone women #gotojailpervert

2020-01-25 15:05:32+00:00,What club? I’m sure Blanca has a complaint for them
2020-01-25 08:08:01+00:00,"... and sexual harassment and sexism and corporate espionage and killing pedestrians, while we're at it."
2020-01-25 04:44:32+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support This has been happening way too frequently! What is the plan to stop this discrimination?
2020-01-25 01:57:16+00:00,I don’t think Uber knows who this man is...
2020-01-25 00:08:18+00:00,You're bad at Twitter and your company has a systemic problem with ADA non-compliance and discrimination.
2020-01-24 21:52:12+00:00,"Educate your drivers, Uber. Educate them or a class action lawsuit is going to be coming your way for the 783rd time this week."

2020-01-24 19:49:32+00:00,"Reading comprehension is not your strong suit, Uber Support."
2020-01-24 13:01:42+00:00,"Hey, @Uber_Support! Y’all should make a translation thing in your app. At the airport in São Paulo unable to communicate with my driver for over 30 minutes because we couldn’t find each other until he finally cancelled. Tight. "
2020-01-24 07:55:16+00:00,"Nonsense, $Uber does nothing to address service wide issues, simply removes drivers from the platform as individuals get caught. What does make a difference is proper training."
2020-01-24 04:59:18+00:00,"Yup, looks like exactly what they are doing with me! Their drivers don’t care and we are always in a hurry to reach our destination, so we cancel and look for another ride."
2020-01-24 04:58:23+00:00,My experience @Uber_Support does absolutely NOTHING ! They will tell you to DM them and then they will disappear . Very disappointing really but that’s how it is.
2020-01-24 04:13:11+00:00,I have already spoken to someone on your Critical Safety Line and reported it in app.
2020-01-23 18:15:34+00:00,FOR FUCK SAKE I ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED ORDER TWICE ON UBEREATS AND NOW I HAVE TWO MEALS ARRIVING @Uber_Support
2020-01-23 16:33:59+00:00,"Hey @dkhos and @Uber_Support, what happened to the significant portion of the surge goes to the driver??? 25% service fee cap should be everywhere, not just in CA!!! "
2020-01-23 09:30:40+00:00,For a 40 minute drive? That sounds fairly normal price wise ( I'm used to Nashville pricing though)
2020-01-23 06:40:51+00:00,We adjust our price according to laws of supply and demand 
2020-01-23 06:30:12+00:00,It cost me $59 dollars to get home just before 6 with @lyft and I thought that was unreal.
2020-01-23 06:23:48+00:00,"The times don't match up? Wtf does that have to do with anything. You think a ride to the airport at 7 pm might have been $250, so what happened with the shooting really wasn't that bad? Get tf outta here with that nonsense."
2020-01-23 06:06:14+00:00,"inb4 ""but the AlGoRiThImS"" without realizing that hey maybe you can manually go in there and change it or better yet why have something that can go up that much in price to begin with"
2020-01-23 05:57:45+00:00,from a friend of mine about the Seattle shooting - a single uber out of the area the shooting happened was almost 10x more expensive than an uber to the airport from her house. @Uber @Uber_Support 
2020-01-23 05:07:47+00:00,I drive Uber — rates increase based on demand and availability. Traffic at a standstill and demand through the roof mean skyrocketing rates. #seattleshooting @Uber_SEA @Uber_Support
2020-01-22 18:56:25+00:00,"Yes , it is wrong.. how can you extra charge by saying waiting if someone already there and wait for cab after booking. @Uber @Uber_Support "
2020-01-22 16:55:03+00:00,So grateful that @Uber_Support explained to me how surge pricing works. . Hasn’t help explain how ride went from $52-71 to 141-171 in 15 mins. I don’t believe the demand change could warrant that. It’s gouging plain and simple.
2020-01-21 23:42:55+00:00,My @Uber Driver took my phone and their NUMBER IS DISCONNECTED. I'm tracking it and see them pull up to a pawn shop.. WTF @Uber_Support why are drivers allowed to drive for you without an active phone number???
2020-01-21 14:16:24+00:00,You're gonna warn them that she is legally and appropriately utilizing their service and then reporting the issue when she is illegally discriminated against?
2020-01-21 13:40:13+00:00,"You clearly don't understand what a WAV is. You need a crash-tested wheelchair to ride in one. A folding wheelchair is not safe. You're falsely accusing her of costing people their jobs. She didn't. If you drive for Uber, you agree to take wheelchairs and service dogs."
2020-01-21 12:52:19+00:00,"But there was evidence of discrimination. If there wasn't discrimination, there wouldn't be evidence of it. Do pay attention. And in your own words, it's Uber who's at fault here for failing to train or discipline their drivers correctly when they're caught breaking the law."
2020-01-21 12:47:20+00:00,I hope @Uber really does something about this. To many women are being victimized while using @Uber and something needs to be done and for the driver to be so confident in nothing that nothing will happen is very concerning
2020-01-21 12:17:12+00:00,Already mentioned I don't need cabs. Uber need to honor its own conditions to allow use on Uber/Zomato or at least refund the amount Else it's pure fraud! @just_outspoken @tejaschogale
2020-01-21 11:48:35+00:00,Makes me think that (once again) Uber management is not doing their job properly. This sort of thing should not even happen ONCE to a disabled person. Surely all drivers should be made aware of this before they start - and told they will be fired if they don't comply?
2020-01-21 10:21:14+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber_India My sister along with my niece (9y/o) and nephew (10y/o) booked a cab at fatehpuri. 1st driver cancelled the cab after confusing her on phone for 15 minutes. She cancelled and booked another cab who also misguided her on phone and asked her to. .
2020-01-21 06:11:24+00:00,I'm allergic to fragrances... By your logic drivers shouldn't allow riders wearing cologne or perfume. HMMMMMMM.
2020-01-21 04:22:09+00:00,"My @uber driver in Paris pulled out a gun on another driver while I was in the car and @Uber_Support did nothing about it, but I bet they’ll be here telling me to DM them within the hour because I put it on social media. The world we live in today."
2020-01-21 00:03:38+00:00,.@Uber_Support How about supporting us by obeying the law? AB5 for instance. #Uberdrivers #uber #starvingdriver #depreciatedcar #tireexpense
2020-01-20 20:36:22+00:00,Hey @Uber and @Uber_Support. I’m a disabled lawyer who has been denied rides by your drivers b/c of my service dog. I’m also friends w/ class action lawyers &amp; civil rights lawyers. Get your drivers on board with ADA laws. NOW.
2020-01-20 20:10:04+00:00,Hey @uber @Uber_Support her service dog Dovi matters just as much as her wheelchair for her HUMAN autonomy
2020-01-20 19:56:25+00:00,"Yo, @Uber_Support @Uber, this has been going on REPEATEDLY for them for at least a week now. What's your damage? Do you really want to be sued? Your drivers REPEATEDLY keep violating the ADA and should be terminated immediately for their behavior."
2020-01-20 19:53:29+00:00,@ACLU Uber needs to be sued if this is how their drivers act. Being disabled is not a crime. Refusing to give them a ride is.
2020-01-20 19:43:47+00:00,If anything you're demonstrating a restraint that I would not be capable of.
2020-01-20 17:29:45+00:00,"@Uber and @Uber_Support need to get on this asap. If they don't, I highly suggest you contact a local news station with the story. Sometimes bad press is the only way these companies will behave ethically."
2020-01-20 17:13:13+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber @Uber_Support @Uber_Support Don’t protect your drivers violating the ADA! Don’t protect them then also harming the people they rejected further by rating them bad customers!
2020-01-20 17:06:53+00:00,Wowww. I really hope @Uber_Support takes care of this!
2020-01-20 15:30:40+00:00,"Thank you. And I hope that driver and the others were deactivated. Please keep complaining when they do this. As someone who’s had trouble getting a ride for other reasons, I love the fact that I can make myself accessible to ANYONE who needs to get around."
2020-01-20 13:08:43+00:00,Off subject but I was shot at with a car full of passengers on New Years. Almost went through the windshield. @uber treated it like a caraccident and says I have to pay a $1000 deductible before they help. So they don’t care about their drivers either.
2020-01-20 13:02:34+00:00,"This pops up every few months. And we have to sign it. I have leather seats and I never deny an animal. Problem is some drivers just don’t care about the job. They are independent contractors. Not employees, and some do t really care about being deactivated. It’s a side hustle."
2020-01-20 11:21:00+00:00,Him repeatedly trying to make sure you ‘understand’ strikes me as really ableist :/
2020-01-20 04:37:04+00:00,I’m surprised no news outlets have picked up in this yet. Can you imagine the clickbait? “@coffeespoonie wants to preserve her grandmother’s memories. There’s only one thing standing in her way: her @Uber_Support drivers.” Seriously though I am so sorry.
2020-01-20 03:09:08+00:00,"As a Lyft driver we have to sign something (Don't know if it's a TOC) that requires us to take Service animals. If we can't do that, we aren't supposed to sign up. Whether it's allergies or fear or leather seats."
2020-01-20 02:12:04+00:00,"If they started docking driver’s pay every time they illegally deny service, & require all drivers to read & sign a TOS notifying them of their responsibilities, that might... might make a difference?"
2020-01-20 01:56:26+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support if someone makes a class action against you can reference this as your millionth ADA violation
2020-01-20 01:06:51+00:00,You have said this on every single one of their tweets this week about this happening every day. This is all you ever reply to the disabled people who have continually experienced this. When are you gonna fucking acknowledge that you have a massive discrimination issue?!
2020-01-20 01:05:38+00:00,So sorry you are dealing with this over & over & over & over again. @Uber_Support @Uber why can’t you do a better job of training your drivers to understand their obligations to serve the public? Do you not understand some members of the public are disabled &amp; have service dogs?
2020-01-20 01:00:31+00:00,ur drivers are leaving a vulnerable population stranded on the sides of streets. this goes beyond a dm. fix your sh!t!!! this is ridiculous and literally against the law???!?!
2020-01-20 00:58:11+00:00,"This is not something that can be solved with a DM. You have a systemic problem with your drivers violating the ADA. Not only does your training need to be revised, you also need to give concrete consequences to violators."
2020-01-20 00:47:18+00:00,"ACT on this. STAT, Uber. No excuses. People, it's past time to start recording for evidence and shaming every driver interaction. #disabilities #ACA #lyft #uber"
2020-01-20 00:34:27+00:00,I’m genuinely wondering rn how often this happens and how many times they let the driver get away with it. @Uber_Support so people who have disabilities and/or need service animals can’t ride with you???
2020-01-20 00:30:37+00:00,"Hey, @Uber_Support You have a serious ADA compliance issue here, and it seems to be ongoing. What are you going to do about it? Something beyond lip service would be wise here."
2020-01-19 21:47:39+00:00,It's not just her. This is a reality for almost every service dog handler that uses your service. You should suspend drivers for a certain amount of time for denying service dogs or other medical equipment.
2020-01-19 17:48:51+00:00,@Uber_Support HOLD YOUR DRIVERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS! THREE TIMES IN ONE WEEK IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!
2020-01-19 17:47:05+00:00,.@Uber_Support this driver denied our friend’s service dog and would not give us a ride and told us to try Uber Pets even after telling him it was illegal. It’s extremely upsetting and she says it happens to her all of the time. Be better. 
2020-01-19 17:13:40+00:00,"When you demand BETTER FOR YOURSELF, you demand better for your customers and your neighbors. The reason I can fight for disabled folks is because I NEVER ACCEPT SECOND-RATE TREATMENT FOR MYSELF. I love fellow disabled people as I love myself. That is why worker struggle matters."
2020-01-19 17:11:09+00:00,I know how management pits drivers and transit support staff against disabled riders. I've lived it. Management does this with EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY disabled customers depend on to survive. This is why it's important that service workers demand better treatment for yourselves.
2020-01-19 15:07:54+00:00,The $3 you gave me was so generous. Such a good company with great customer service. (Sarcasm by the way)
2020-01-19 11:41:46+00:00,@Uber_Support Today I took an intercity #Uber 50% promotion #PlanSetHai The Driver insistently charged ₹300 extra over bill in cash with no receipt in the name of toll&amp; state tax. No app option to file such complaints.The ride couldn’t be booked with online payment. #UberCheats
2020-01-19 09:52:56+00:00,Support your local minicab/taxis who are being driven out of business by Uber’s investor subsidised fares designed to kill competition & public transport so you will have no choice & they can hike prices. They also avoid tax which denies funding to@public services.
2020-01-19 05:21:41+00:00,. @Uber_Support you’ve been doing great for me lately. Just thought I’d shoot something positive your way.
2020-01-19 04:40:44+00:00,Uber support is the worst. Don’t expect a resolution.

2020-01-16 04:52:40+00:00,@Uber_Support this is a really great idea to consider
2020-01-16 02:47:37+00:00,Everytime I've been cancelled on with Lyft the driver went out of their way to inform me why they did so.
2020-01-16 02:30:53+00:00,Saaaaame! I've had a few denials with Lyft but I can't remember the last one I had.
2020-01-16 02:10:56+00:00,In all honesty my experiences with Lyft are way better than what I've had with Uber
2020-01-16 00:49:30+00:00,"LOL. You think ‘Tech’ is the answer? How about fully trained, fully Police checked, fully medical checked drivers in purpose built wheel chair friendly vehicles.... Oh, we already have them..... "
2020-01-15 23:51:38+00:00,"He ended the ride and essentially FORCED me out his car in the middle of nowhere because he didn’t want to go to my destination. I WANT A REFUND AND THEN SOME!!!!!!! And in the words of white women everywhere, I WANT THIS MAN FIRED! @Uber_Support"
2020-01-15 23:49:33+00:00,My Uber driver refused to drive me any further after he accepted my ride and started driving because HE was late to something and my destination was in the opposite direction of where he was going. Like literally stopped the car and wouldn’t go further. @Uber_Support
2020-01-15 22:40:50+00:00,"I'm just gonna warn you Uber support is the worst about SD discrimination. They'll give you a $5 ride credit and nothing else. I've had much less ride cancellations and better experience with Lyft as an SD owner, though it's not perfect there either. "
2020-01-15 22:40:29+00:00,"Oh my goodness, I’m so sorry. Have you reported him? I actually took an @Uber tonight. @Uber_Support please take note of this."
2020-01-15 21:16:06+00:00,"An @Uber driver just ran into a parked car in front of my house. While fleeing the scene, he managed to hit the parked car AGAIN, busting his drivers door in the process. He got out again to tear pieces off his car, then sped off into traffic. License: “MMMM45” @Uber_Support"
2020-01-15 19:43:59+00:00,plus pre-hire a new driver—always ask if they are allergic to service animals. Categorize them accordingly via app options.
2020-01-15 19:38:12+00:00,perhaps you can help to educate Uber drivers to bring in a mat cover or doggy mitts to prevent scratch or dirty seat if needed
2020-01-15 19:10:30+00:00,"This is what misleading advertising looks like. “If it’s on Uber Eats, there’s no delivery fee.” Nope, the $15 order minimum also applies to free delivery. Step up your game @Uber_Support @UberEats"
2020-01-15 16:42:41+00:00,@Uber_Support the final amount for my ride was around 120 rupees more than the estimated.
2020-01-15 15:15:30+00:00,"Bruh, @Uber you need to vet your driver's better, or run a small IQ test. @Uber_Support "
2020-01-15 10:57:52+00:00,"@Uber_Support @UberINSupport @Uber_India Hi Uber, I see rates shows double when I use in my app but same place in my friend app shows low fare. This is not ethical."
2020-01-15 08:21:19+00:00,".@Olacabs and @Uber, @Uber_Support must investigate this and let us know if the man in question is your driver. I fail to understand why the journalist recording this statement never bothered to clarify that all his fears are unfounded? Can Quint please publish more facts?"
2020-01-14 23:37:53+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber Friends please retweet!!!
2020-01-14 23:30:17+00:00,"If there are a set number of medallions in a city, there won't be an unlimited amount of drivers driving down wages and cars creating congestion. Stop believing all the Uber created propaganda about the ""big bad taxi industry"". Cities create the taxi rules & fares."
2020-01-14 21:01:48+00:00,"hey @Uber_Support me again! Your customer service team told me I’d get a response within 2 days, it’s been almost a week. A refund is probably the least you could do at this point "
2020-01-14 20:42:23+00:00,stop trying to get a notice from her
2020-01-14 20:38:36+00:00,Alredy DM u

2020-01-14 18:55:06+00:00,I'm still laughing at how I sent @Uber / @Uber_Support several desperate DM's when I lost my phone in Mexico and they never read the emails or wrote back except to ask if I was satisfied with the customer service I received. *dead*
2020-01-14 14:48:16+00:00,"If the driver says “abhi aa raha hun” after you have told him the destination, rest assured he is going t cancel ride. @Uber_Support"

2020-01-14 09:11:37+00:00,Terrible services by @Uber. They have the policy of disappointing &amp; troubling the loyal and old customers. No respect for customers at all. Shameful #Uber. @Uber_Support @Uber_India #BoycottUber
2020-01-14 04:00:09+00:00,"First and *last* time I use the “Share delivery with a nearby order” of UberEats. Dude delivered me the food the other customer ordered, @Uber_Support "

2020-01-14 02:26:05+00:00,@Uber_Support Been waiting for an order for over an hour. Original ETA was 8:30. Driver has not moved an inch.
2020-01-14 00:31:17+00:00,Not being able to speak to a live customer service representative at @Uber or @Uber_Support is one of the more maddening experiences of our time
2020-01-13 19:57:35+00:00,It's shocking that @UberEats South Africa drivers do mutiple deliveries in one order pick up from a restaurant resulting in cold food. Uber driver ommited to doing multiples deliveries. @Uber_Support says its not their fault that the food was delivered cold but its @kfc fault.
2020-01-13 16:54:19+00:00,"if you love getting food that's delivered late, cold, and soggy, and then being blown off by incompetent and terrible customer support, definitely go with @UberEats @Uber_Support"
2020-01-13 15:27:54+00:00,"Super reckless @Uber_Support @Uber driver blasts down Washington Bus lane before swinging into ""protected"" bike lane right in front of bikers to disgorge. Super classy finger fella. @bikelaneuprise #bikechi"
2020-01-13 11:36:38+00:00,Gosh @Uber @Uber_Support S U C K S Big time. ETA turns into completing trip. Drivers ask Drop Location Drivers then ask you to cancel Finally a driver arrives stops bang in the middle of the road. Shame!
2020-01-13 07:55:06+00:00,Booked a car with @Uber. I was outside my house at 06.55 for an 07.00 pickup. No driver by 07.03 so I called him and he appeared lost. I continued to wait and at 07.08. Cancelled appeared on my app. Then a £6.00 charge was emailed to me. Must do better @Uber_Support Not happy.
2020-01-12 15:47:00+00:00,£55 for a couple chips accidentally dropped on the floor is actually ridiculous @Uber @Uber_Support 
2020-01-12 07:12:35+00:00,"Ah, that is probably what happened with a young woman travelling with 2 children and looking for a connection to the domestic terminal and now in danger of missing a flight. Driver said he was close and didn't turn up, she tried to rebook and got a colossal surge @Uber_Support "
2020-01-12 07:09:06+00:00,"Today my car was 5 mins away, suddenly gone, searches for a new car miles away. Rebook. It is 20% higher. Everyone at the airport was saying the same thing. @Uber_Support @Uber_India"
2020-01-12 07:06:02+00:00,They use what they call a dynamic pricing model purely based on demand n supply...apart from this ther database remembers a repeat customer who's paid more for last trip from an XYZ location n shows em hiked price on consecutive booking..
2020-01-12 07:02:36+00:00,Worse they listen to the location and delay intentionally so that the rider is forced to cancel and look for another booking
2020-01-12 06:58:26+00:00,And they don't have a customer service outfit. Only have bots and young kids in the line of fire
2020-01-12 06:56:32+00:00,"The last time I complained, a kid from the social media cell called @Uber_Support. It is poor from #UberIndia to expose them to angry customers and bear the brunt for no fault of theirs because the organisation stays faceless."
2020-01-12 06:52:11+00:00,I tweeted today because it wasn't just me. So many others complaining of cars not coming and prices going up dramatically. Hence my concern that it is an exploitative algorithm but happy to learn more. #UberIndia @Uber_Support 
2020-01-12 06:46:37+00:00,I don't think it's any worse than Bangalore.
2020-01-12 06:46:27+00:00,"Sadly they dont care harsha, far too often drivers are calling customers to check where they want to go and then cancelling."
2020-01-12 06:43:20+00:00,At Mumbai airport. So many passengers held hostage by @Uber_India's extraordinarily poor approach. You would have thought they would have got their act together by now. Unless of course it benefits the algorithm. @Uber_Support. Might seem like a rant but #Uber has to acknowledge
2020-01-11 22:58:08+00:00,TFL Told you not to use them as they are now operating without a licence. Serves you right
2020-01-11 22:47:43+00:00,"And this is why I use @lyft. I’ve found their policies and procedures to be much more user-focused. They actually put the customer first and care about their safety, unlike @Uber. I’m so sorry this happened. Let us know how we can support you."
2020-01-11 22:47:27+00:00,"To be clear, @Uber_Support only asked for my number #onhere to publicly fake any attempt to provide assistance. I am beyond clear that @Uber has lost me as a customer moving forward. Bad service at every stage except for my actual driver. "
2020-01-11 21:51:14+00:00,"So an @Uber driver basically kidnapped @jilly_peppa, a disabled woman of color, when she dozed off in a car. And @Uber_Support not only is minimizing how traumatic this trip was, but also won't even do the BARE MINIMUM by refunding her over $130 ride? Make it make sense. "
2020-01-11 20:11:11+00:00,"So basically Uber doesn't care that you were LITERALLY KIDNAPPED while you were dozing, and then charged for the favor?!!! That is some Grade A Bullshittery. They best make this right while its still as inexpensive as refunding your $120ish charge."
2020-01-11 19:46:12+00:00,I’m always on there wasting money... thanks for helping with my food addiction by making it easy for me to delete the account and save my dosh! @Uber_Support @UberEats
2020-01-11 16:42:08+00:00,"You gave them a specific destination. They took you elsewhere. That sounds like kidnapping. While it may be in accordance with their standards, it’s definitely not in accordance with the law."
2020-01-11 11:22:11+00:00,"So after several back and forth conversations with @Uber_Support, they have doubled down on their right to overcharge me. Easy decision to delete @Uber app and take my business elsewhere. "
2020-01-11 10:58:52+00:00,"More than 24 hours since we posted this story, still no official word from @UberINSupport @Uber @Uber_Support The safety and well being of a passenger is paramount and Uber India must explain why they allowed a paperless driver to drive their cab? "
2020-01-11 09:15:52+00:00,"We definitely want to get this sorted out. Please send us a DM with the phone number associated with your Uber account, so we can assist you further."
2020-01-11 09:05:17+00:00,hopped in an @uber during rush hour &amp; could visibly see heavy traffic &amp;clear road obstructions. The longer trip was knowable and should’ve been initially reflected in the charge- instead my total was 3 times my estimated cost despite KNOWABLE factors. @Uber_Support is trash.
2020-01-11 04:25:21+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support also, he was rude as hell. We are not here to take shit from people around. This is not the first time something like this happened. It will be the last time i am using your service, if this repeats again."
2020-01-11 04:17:54+00:00,Holy shit. How is this not against @Uber's rules??? This is why I use @Lyft. When things went wrong with them they were always quick to help. Fuck Uber.
2020-01-10 23:41:25+00:00,"Dude honestly @Uber is the most frustrating company to resolve something with ever. I’ve been working with @Uber_Support for over a week to have my account fixed and it’s getting no where. They suck, use Lyft"
2020-01-10 21:38:48+00:00,I ain’t saying nothin!
2020-01-10 17:38:41+00:00,Dear @Uber_Support @Uber your drivers are calling up to enquire about location and cancelling rides. Three drivers. Is there some kind of action taken against these drivers.
2020-01-10 15:09:14+00:00,So @Uber_Support why was my Uber pool like 6 bucks more than what the app told me it would be? He picked up multiple people
2020-01-10 10:14:41+00:00,"@Uber_India @Uber_Support hey what’s your call to action when your drivers claim coming to a location, no call/no notification on your app saying they’re on location, start the trip without the rider in it &amp; then cancel it, levying me a cancellation fee?"
2020-01-10 00:19:55+00:00,That is 100% theft.
2020-01-09 23:59:23+00:00,I've definitely dozed off before and it would make me lose track of time. But it really disturbs me that a driver would use that as an opportunity to take a ride drastically off course. The money is a HUGE issue but also the safety of that.
2020-01-09 23:55:52+00:00,"Following and hoping you get some help from Uber on this. WTF with this route, how long did the ride end up being?! (Beyond the enormous amount of money it's also a huge waste of your time)"
2020-01-09 22:55:51+00:00,Do your own work uber
2020-01-09 13:37:46+00:00,@uber @Uber_Support @UberEats has really screwed me. Their poor security allowed my account to be hacked and fraudulently charged $90 and they don't seem to care. Won't respond to anything. Help me get a refund. #uber #ubersucks #ubereats #viral
2020-01-09 13:27:46+00:00,"Hello @Uber @Uber_India @Uber_Support, please confirm immediately if you allow Drivers on your platform without verification and proper identification documents. If yes, I would immediately cancel my subscription. Waiting for your prompt reply as this is a major safety concern! "
2020-01-09 13:21:46+00:00,"Hello, @Uber_India @Uber_Support I want to only book Abdul from today kindly update how I can do that. "
2020-01-09 12:42:19+00:00,Is this what he said is correct? Are drivers kept in your uber without documents verified ?? If this is true then traveling in uber is very harmful. @Uber_India @Uber_Support 
2020-01-09 08:01:05+00:00,@Uber_India @Uber_Support has not yet replied. Uninstalling the app nd making sure I encourage ppl to use other services available in market.
2020-01-09 05:10:01+00:00,Wow ! You got a blue tick! What kind of followers you have? Or are you trying to suggest me that I shouldn’t travel with Uber as they don’t verify the drivers before hiring their cabs? @Uber_Support is this your security standard to female passengers?
2020-01-08 19:42:27+00:00,@aktalkies pls share info about this driver. This is serious negligence towards passenger safety. How can @Uber_India hire someone who doesn’t have any docs? It’s clearly stated here that you need the following documents. @Uber_Support kindly look into this. 
2020-01-08 18:58:50+00:00,"Update: they did nothing. Once again, @Uber_Support @Uber has lost a customer and I’ll make sure to spread the word of my experience."
2020-01-08 17:37:38+00:00,".@Uber @Uber_Support Your driver is neither coming to the pick up point, nor taking my calls, nor cancelling the trip. What am I supposed to do please? Thanks "
2020-01-08 14:43:47+00:00,Sorry Delhi police is busy beating students.
2020-01-08 13:42:02+00:00,"If the driver cancels, why the fuck do u charge me? Do u have your brains pierced with your dicks? Have to waste my time every time for the refund. @Uber_Support @uber"
2020-01-08 13:06:18+00:00,"(1/2) hey @Uber_Support every time I try to say my driver took a poor route which caused me to pay more than what was originally what I had accepted in the app, your app keeps saying that I was charged the amount that was quoted. Your app is not user friendly whatsoever.."
2020-01-07 18:22:57+00:00,Uber charged me a $150 cleaning fee 5 days after a ride cause one of their drivers sent this pic in. I sat in the back seat during this ride and was alone by the way. This how you treat your customers??? @Uber @Uber_Support 
2020-01-07 14:16:24+00:00,Forgot my phone on my last trip. Please help @UberNigeria @Uber_Support
2020-01-07 11:29:05+00:00,"Interesting that you care about the Hollywood elite but when my sister was left stranded in the middle of nowhere because of her @Uber Driver, you refunded her $5. I guess the rest of us are just peasants to you."
2020-01-07 08:46:37+00:00,The problem is that your friend isn't famous. They seem pretty quick to give personalized service if you have a bunch of followers.
2020-01-07 06:10:08+00:00,"yeah i have ulcerative colitis that turns into crohns and during flares, when i gotta go i gotta GO. if not, i can have terrible pains and even soil myself. this is terrible."
2020-01-07 05:23:50+00:00,"FFS, I sympathize w/anyone who's received comically bad customer non-service from @Uber_Support. Congratulations, business must be *fantastic* if you can ignore 8 DMs over a 6-day period! Take note evil overlords @Uber. Someone there needs a pink slip &amp; a serious ass-kicking!"
2020-01-07 03:44:37+00:00,um... my uber just threatened me and said if i didnt stream her new album she’d drop me off in a random alley HELP? @Uber_Support 
2020-01-07 01:05:28+00:00,Yo @Uber_Support why do I have to pay a cancelation fee if your driver missed 4 exits and will make me late? Of course I canceled it and called a new one. 
2020-01-06 23:50:32+00:00,"Leave the dude alone. When you have to go, you have to go... don't you dare take his ability to make money over this."
2020-01-06 21:04:03+00:00,What shouldn’t be happening is you firing an employee that just got humiliated in front of millions for using a bathroom they were given permission to use. Goddamn sociopath
2020-01-06 20:47:13+00:00,"No @Uber_Support, just no. Your drivers work every hour under the sun, you treat them like dirt. They have to shit like everyone else. He asked, she consented. Both you and @itsgabrielleu should be ashamed of your actions."
2020-01-06 19:16:34+00:00,Pay people more and they won’t feel the need to do SO MANY driving jobs per day yay they can’t even take a bathroom break.
2020-01-06 19:00:28+00:00,"Yeah. I was thinking what the worst-case scenario might've been. I'm pretty sensitive to bad odours, but geeze, pooing is an unavoidable part of being human, and sometimes it does take a while. Ranting on social media is a bit much. A whinge text to a friend would've been better!"
2020-01-06 16:26:53+00:00,And good luck finding any of those places anywhere near Gabrielle Union's mansion.
2020-01-06 16:06:30+00:00,Leon your job is being beautiful. Don’t think anything less
2020-01-06 15:06:55+00:00,"People shouldn’t be using the bathroom? Damn, this job ain’t for everyone I guess."
2020-01-06 09:45:43+00:00,Next you'll be stopping your drivers from breathing because they accidentally sighed in the direction of the customer and got reported for breathing on thier face Not to mention how unsecure your systems are and leaking customer information 
2020-01-06 08:32:28+00:00,"Wait, are you saying that your drivers should not possess biological functions? The customer gave permission to use the restroom ffs."
2020-01-06 08:05:52+00:00,What the hell? Your drivers can’t use the bathroom EVEN WHEN they ask for permission? That’s horrible. I’m glad I have always boycotted your sad anti-union company.
2020-01-06 03:07:57+00:00,Hey Uber you should just let this one slide
2020-01-06 02:33:47+00:00,Thankful theirs still people with humanity in this world. We've all been there at some point.
2020-01-06 02:25:31+00:00,"Hell no, you should NOT be following up on this. Everybody poops, Uber -- if a minor celebrity wants to whine about somebody shitting in the intended receptacle then it says more about them as a person than about the driver's need to perform a normal human bodily function."
2020-01-06 02:23:18+00:00,"Especially when he asked and the person said yes... I mean, come on."
2020-01-06 02:21:52+00:00,"The threat is she'll get 1 starred on an app. Clearly, this is on the same level as abducting someone for ransom "
2020-01-06 02:18:41+00:00,"The NERVE of that driver! To have an urgent and uncontrollable need to have a natural bodily-function as if he's some kind of... PERSON. @Uber_Support if you don't handle this, I'm going to be HIGHLY upset. Next time they should shit in the car like the inhuman slaves they are."
2020-01-06 02:06:51+00:00,dude had to shit relax
2020-01-06 01:29:47+00:00,Uber support told this person they're worthless flesh. And we're witnesses. Lawsuit time.
2020-01-06 01:17:53+00:00,"What, lol?"
2020-01-06 01:17:43+00:00,And she could've just said no
2020-01-06 00:51:56+00:00,If they fire this man I’m deleting Uber and never using it again
2020-01-05 23:44:30+00:00,Hey maybe sit this one out Uber Support
2020-01-05 22:47:53+00:00,Uber: they should be shitting in their car!!!
2020-01-05 21:43:12+00:00,A guy just wanted to use the bathroom
2020-01-05 21:31:10+00:00,Heartless a$$holes. Are you all machines that don't poop? Sometimes people can't hold it in. YEESH!
2020-01-05 21:28:15+00:00,It only takes one ride to kill someone so.... let her warn ppl in peace
2020-01-05 21:09:22+00:00,Where should your drivers do poops?
2020-01-05 20:55:25+00:00,DO NOT DARE punish this worker for needing to use the bathroom.
2020-01-05 17:17:16+00:00,"Had a very bad, almost laughable experience with @Uber and @Uber_Support in Mexico. Our driver added an airport fee for a 5 minute drive from a bar to our hotel. Obviously no airport was involved in this trip. @Uber_Support has refused to make it right for us."
2020-01-05 16:16:03+00:00,We had him too!!!! We thought he was wasted. Swerving all over the road! And kept telling us weiiiird jokes too!!
2020-01-05 05:56:15+00:00,Almost died in a Uber today- side note this was on the highway @Uber_Support 
2020-01-05 04:56:16+00:00,"EVERYONE IN ROCHESTER DO NOT GET INTO AN UBER WITH THIS MAN! He seemed intoxicated, was swerving, did not follow directions on the GPS, and made very uncomfortable dirty jokes! Me and @erikaradimissis made him drop us off @the nearest Wegmans. BAD GUY! @Uber @Uber_Support "
2020-01-05 04:45:53+00:00,Why @Uber allows these scamny drivers in Mexico City? Driver drops me off at the Sofitel Reforma but doesn't end the trip for other two hours? The @Uber_Support via app is useless. 
2020-01-04 20:54:19+00:00,Reported a man for having a towel covering his lap and acting strange in an Uber and mentioned it smelled funny too & they replied that they try to keep their vehicles odor free? How about keeping your buisness weirdo free? Just an idea ! @Uber @Uber_Support
2020-01-04 13:04:36+00:00,He is a human. Humans sometimes have to go to the bathroom. He did not have one available so he asked to use it. What is the big problem? Are they now not allowed to have basic human necessities?
2020-01-04 12:58:04+00:00,"Please don't pay extra to @Uber_Support @Uber_PKR and ask them to add it to your wallet because at least half the time, the amount won't be added and you'll waste ages trying to type the complaint. Happened to me twice in one day."
2020-01-04 04:04:44+00:00,"@Uber drivers pee in bottles to make money since 35% is been taken out of their hard earned deuce. They want to suspend a driver for satisfying a nature call. This world is crazy, thanks @itsgabrielleu for ur kindness, and I hope that guy wasn't African. #jollofmaster"
2020-01-04 03:55:15+00:00,Can someone at @Uber_Support help this person? 
2020-01-04 03:49:31+00:00,Sometimes you can hold that deuce all day. And sometimes that deuce is coming out in the next 10 seconds!
2020-01-04 02:30:00+00:00,"Pinpoint the ""threat"" and validity of the the ""threat""."
2020-01-03 23:53:27+00:00,Y’all need to have bathroom hubs for drivers if this “shouldn’t be happening” seriously where are drivers supposed to go?
2020-01-03 16:08:57+00:00,"Exactly! I just wrote it that he could be sick, I have allergies to lactose, gluten, and bad colitis, some days are hell."
2020-01-03 16:06:32+00:00,"Why do you have to be so specific? That's rude and you don't know if the Uber driver has Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's disease, C.Diff Colitis, etc. it sounded like an emergency and is obviously that he/she needs to work, now he or she will lose this job."
2020-01-03 14:04:35+00:00,Snitch
2020-01-03 11:14:04+00:00,Well of course they’re unprofessional that’s what they are. Should have used black cabs first . It’s your pregnant wife for Christ sake and using a company who’s licence has been refused
2020-01-03 10:34:34+00:00,"Had a @Deliveroo_AU order not arrive today. Instead of being arseholes about it like @Uber_Support would have been, they fully refunded me, without me even having to contact them. That’s how you do customer support."
2020-01-03 07:53:24+00:00,"So @uber @Uber_Support, how is refunding me down to $300 satisfactory? What about the driver that gets no punishment for blatantly scamming us? What stops him from scamming other customers? How is this at all acceptable..."
2020-01-03 05:29:49+00:00,"@Uber_Support I just bought $50 credits on Uber and now I can’t order my food, what’s the issue? "
2020-01-03 03:51:26+00:00,It’s sad & unnecessary. I feel bad for the person who was put on blast.
2020-01-03 03:50:11+00:00,I think this is a pretty crude story to relate on twitter. Obviously the person was having an emergency. Where is the humanity? Did they deficate all over your bathroom? Now this person will loose their job. It’s this twitter post that stinks. #havesomehumanity
2020-01-03 02:59:37+00:00,Apparently taking pictures of the customer in the process of throwing up in your car is not enough evidence for @Uber_Support @Uber to reimburse me as the driver for cleaning fees. What more proof could you give? Then have a @Uber employee ride with all drivers from now on. #uber
2020-01-03 02:04:28+00:00,I waited for 20 min for my Uber and the driver called and got mad at me because they didn’t know where they were going then canceled it. Bad look @Uber_Support
2020-01-03 01:32:55+00:00,Uh oh. Somebody in trouble.
2020-01-02 23:16:30+00:00,"Hey @Uber @Uber_Support I went in to see if you had deleted it per my request, and now I can see my 2FA was turned off. Why would you turn my 2FA off after I asked my account to be deleted? There is definitely some suspicious activity going on! "
2020-01-02 23:10:44+00:00,"Uber scam? Hey folks, check your credit card statements for an unwanted $24.99 charge for a Ride Pass. And forget about calling them--you just yet a recording telling you to write them via support@uber.com. You can query them @Uber_Support , but don't expect a quick answer."
2020-01-02 22:17:38+00:00,"an @Uber driver has my phone but has intentionally sent my calls to voicemail since he said he would drop it of yesterday morning, now I got a flight tonight and can't get in touch with him or @Uber_Support "
2020-01-02 20:10:58+00:00,Got some serious questions @Uber_Support
2020-01-02 09:47:19+00:00,@Uber_Support how is this acceptable?
2020-01-02 08:42:05+00:00,"Was just laughed at by your disgusting excuse for a 'customer service supervisor' for having Laryngitis and trying to fix a incorrect charge. Deleting the app and never using any of your services again. You need a whole new support line, what an absolute joke. @Uber_Support"
2020-01-02 04:21:35+00:00,@VOANews @UberEats @Uber_Support @Uber @UberFacts @UBERTRUTH2 A glimpse of larceny being perpetuated by this company!! The charges listed were fraudulently made by different account using MY debit card They’ve given me the runaround for 2 mos &amp; now say it can’t be refunded...
2020-01-02 04:19:20+00:00,Props to @Uber_Support for helping a girl get her refund. Many thanks! 
2020-01-02 02:37:53+00:00,"LA people, did Uber get rid of their ride pass subscription? I no longer have it within my app to purchase. @Uber @Uber_Support"
2020-01-01 15:36:23+00:00,"hey @Uber @Uber_Support it is not okay that my fare when i called said one thing, my receipt says a higher price and now my account says 4x what i thought i was paying."
2020-01-01 14:55:53+00:00,I have to piss
2020-01-01 14:53:47+00:00,.@Uber_India @Uber_Support a cash trip we paid for shows as not paid and requests that it be paid on the next trip. There is no option on your app for this issue.
2020-01-01 14:47:56+00:00,@Uber_Support really disappointed to get poor customer support for an issue of unwanted order placement due to technical issues on new years eve. Now I am being forced to pay for an order I never made !! Looking forward for a solution @UberEats #LetsEats #ConsumerRight
2020-01-01 14:44:28+00:00,"@Uber @Uber_Support Uber drivers are operating AC ,only on customer reminder they operate in Hyderabad As u are charging surge prices please see that ur drivers operate AC in cars"
2020-01-01 12:58:14+00:00,@Uber_Support why are scheduled rides a thing when the driver will just accept and then cancel the ride when its time to pick up? scheduled a ride to the airport and our driver accepted it 45 minutes ago and canceled 4 minutes before they were to pick us up. Now we are scrambling
2020-01-01 12:43:18+00:00,"A question was asked, on a public forum, how about an answer to that question?"
2020-01-01 12:23:58+00:00,"@UberINSupport @Uber_Support @PrParameswaran pl refund incorrectly collected toll charges for rides of 23,24,26,27,30n 31 dec...this year at least be responsive #uberdontcare"
2020-01-01 11:54:01+00:00,@Uber @Uber_Support @UberINSupport @AhmedabadPolice This to report you your wonderful service that never comes... Your driver never show up... This guy told me if you are paying cash then only he will come and stopped picking calls then after.
2020-01-01 11:51:26+00:00,This has quite some potential. Excited for season 3 when @Uber_Support will learn of the existence of non-uber bikes.
2020-01-01 11:48:53+00:00,Hey @Uber_Support some asshole driver just pretended to pick me up. But I'm still outside waiting... pic.twitter.com/tinvzl9K0W
2020-01-01 10:36:15+00:00,This is exactly why I deleted the app from my phone. It's beyond annoying
2020-01-01 10:27:24+00:00,So bad. They just write to show support. No action happens. My walking stuck has still not been found. It's been a week. Inspite of Sharing details.of my uber cab. Plz at least resolve this problem
2020-01-01 10:20:52+00:00,@Uber_India this has happened for the second time. Why are you requesting a cancelation fee from me when your driver has cancelled it from his end? @Uber @Uber_Support 
2020-01-01 09:58:02+00:00,My food was supposed to arrive an hour ago and hasn’t shown up and the restaurant won’t answer the phone or give me an update @Uber @Uber_Support @UberEats
2020-01-01 08:47:18+00:00,Amazing start of 2020..-All thanks to @Uber @Uber_Support I forgot my phone in Morning in the cab. since then driver is not reachable neither #Uber..#2020NewYear #Happy2020 #happynewyear2020 #Uber #Fml
2020-01-01 07:56:23+00:00,I am literally crying. I'm so hungry and I waited up an extra 2 hours instead of going to bed & they cancel my order. @Uber_Support I get that it's new years but my status said they were wrapping things up &amp; giving it to my driver at 2 am &amp; now its canceled an hour later? 
2020-01-01 06:52:10+00:00,Ok boomer.
2020-01-01 02:19:01+00:00,Surge is iight sometimes.. But on the biggest drinking nights of the year I don’t think people should be forced to choose between a crazy expensive sober ride or driving drunk. It shouldn’t be a difficult decision no matter a person’s socioeconomic status
2020-01-01 01:37:15+00:00,my uber driver just ripped ass in the car and it reeked. @Uber_Support i want my money back

2020-01-01 00:54:05+00:00,I'm sick of your Kenyan drivers that are always refusing to go where i go. Either kick them from the system or fine them so they behave like a proper driver @Uber_Support

2020-01-01 00:48:06+00:00,"Seriously this is the dumbest conversation I’ve ever read, clearly they aren’t doing pre-ordered trips for a reason and it makes sense. If you don’t how to order an Uber while you’re drinking and ready to go home then you shouldn’t even be going out anyways."
2020-01-01 00:47:47+00:00,Had the same with a $10 tip. The pax wanted to sit in my car and wait to see it hit my account. Never came. Ever.
2020-01-01 00:40:33+00:00,I thought @uber @Uber_Support didn’t allow drivers to cancel trips because they didn’t like the destination? There are a ton of us stranded at Disney Paris with tons of Uber’s in the lot canceling all the rides. #WTF
2020-01-01 00:33:26+00:00,Ugh. @UberEats trying to use my $35 Amex Platinum credit at @BWWings before it expires. The app charged the wrong card. Can’t cancel &amp; reorder without huge fee. Help me @Uber_Support

2020-01-01 00:12:18+00:00,And when I went to gather that information the app stopped working. Then I tried to log in through the browser and got the message in the first tweet. So yeah. Uber is fucking with us. My boyfriend and I don't appreciate it. Just give us our refund.
2020-01-01 00:09:42+00:00,So I kept nagging and finally got
2020-01-01 00:09:33+00:00,@Uber_Support @Uber was waiting 42 minutes for a pick up initially ten mins away. Messaged and called driver several times to no reply and asked him to cancel. Ended up having to cancel for €10 fee. Find this unfair and want to know how I get a refund not just Uber credit.
2020-01-01 00:09:05+00:00,Problem is our delivery choices are limited. I don't live in the United States anymore so we don't have all the services Americans have. And we contacted the restaurant after we saw what happened and they said to contact Über. Uber said this.
2020-01-01 00:01:48+00:00,Appreciate the reply but it's been like this for about 3 months
